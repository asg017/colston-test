On August 23, 2020, Jacob S. Blake, (born April 30, 1991) a 29-year-old black man, was shot from behind seven times by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Protests occurred in response, as part of the larger Black Lives Matter movement which had seen a resurgence in the wake of high-profile police killings in 2020, including those of George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks, and Breonna Taylor.

Witnesses said that Blake had been attempting to break up a fight between two women. Police were responding to a call about a domestic dispute, and subsequently attempted to subdue Blake with a taser. A bystander who heard police yelling "drop the knife" recorded a video which showed Blake surrounded by police with their weapons drawn. Blake was reportedly unarmed. He walked around his vehicle and attempted to enter it. As he did, one police officer grabbed him and fired his weapon into Blake's back. Blake's attorney later said that Blake's three sons were inside the vehicle at the time, and that Blake had been going to check on them. Blake was left in serious condition and flown to Froedtert Hospital.

Protests followed, leading the Kenosha County government to declare a state of emergency overnight on August 24 after police vehicles were damaged, a dump truck was set on fire, and the local courthouse was vandalized. One officer was hit in the head with a brick, and tear gas was deployed. Police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of what it alleged were "numerous" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired.

Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued a statement denouncing the excessive use of force by police and invoking the names of African Americans killed by law enforcement. Evers said, While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country. Evers called Wisconsin state lawmakers into a special session to pass legislation addressing police brutality. Subsequently, he deployed the Wisconsin National Guard to maintain public safety after the shooting. Up to 200 members will be deployed.

Presidential candidate Joe Biden said, "these shots pierce the soul of our nation".

The family of Jacob Blake has retained attorney Benjamin Crump, the same civil attorney who represented the families of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown in their civil suits.

According to Wisconsin Circuit Court Access online records, a Jacob S. Blake, same age and with an address in the same block where the shooting occurred, had a warrant issued for him on July 7 on pending accusations of misdemeanor criminal trespass to a dwelling with domestic abuse as a modifier; felony third-degree sexual assault with domestic abuse as a modifier; and misdemeanor disorderly conduct with domestic abuse as a modifier. A support action was dismissed, and the only other case that comes up is for not having a driver’s license.

A 2015 story in Racine Eye described how "Racine police say K9 Dozer had to help officers take a man into custody when the man refused to go quietly into custody after he pulled a gun at a local bar." The man was described as Jacob Blake, 24, of Racine, which makes him the same age as the man shot by police on August 23. The Racine Eye story says he was charged with "one felony count of resisting arrest causing a soft tissue injury to a police officer and one misdemeanor count each of carrying a concealed weapon, carrying a firearm while intoxicated, endangering safety-use of a dangerous weapon, and disorderly conduct." Those charges don't show up on the circuit court website though.

That story further alleges, "Blake and two women were at the Brass Monkey tavern, 1436 Junction Avenue, Saturday when Blake got into an argument with another patron and pulled a black handgun. Blake pointed the gun at the other man, and the magazine fell to the floor. The bartender told Blake to leave, and he did but then pointed the gun through the window at patrons inside the bar before walking south on Junction Avenue."

Police stopped Blake in a "high risk traffic stop" but he "exited the SUV and started walking toward officers and ignored commands to get down on the ground," the story says. That's when officers forced him to the ground and used a K9 when he kept resisting, the story adds.

The Racine Eye reported that Blake was found to have had a handgun on the floor of his SUV driver's seat during a 2015 arrest: While police were at the hospital with Blake so he could be treated for the wound he obtained from K9 Dozer, officers say he refused to answer questions, but he did submit to a legal blood draw to determine his level of intoxication. At the time he was taken into custody, Blake was searched and police say he had a holster on his hip but no gun. A subsequent search of the SUV turned up a black handgun on the floor behind the drivers seat. A box of ammunition was also found, and two loaded magazines were discovered in Blake’s coat.
