On August 23, 2020, Jacob S. Blake, a 29-year-old American black man, was shot from behind seven times by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States. Police were attempting to arrest Blake during a domestic dispute, during which Blake was tased and scuffled briefly with officers. He was shot as he tried to enter his SUV, where his children were in the backseat. The shooting was followed by protests, property damage, fires in downtown Kenosha, and further clashes with riot police. Commentators drew links between the Blake shooting, the reaction, and the larger Black Lives Matter movement, which had seen a resurgence in the wake of high-profile police killings in 2020, including those of George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks, and Breonna Taylor.

Police responded to a 911 call. Blake's attorney, Benjamin Crump, said Blake "was attempting to de-escalate a fight between two other people when officers arrived at the scene", and that Blake tried to enter his vehicle to check on his three sons inside. According to witness Raysean White, Blake had pulled his car up near "six or seven women shouting at each other on the sidewalk" and "Blake did not say anything to the women".

Officers attempted to subdue Blake, and a taser was deployed. A bystander who recorded a video of the incident heard police yelling "drop the knife", and also said, "I didnâ€™t see any weapons in his hands, he wasn't being violent". Other reports said Blake was unarmed. After an initial scuffle, Blake got away and walked to the driver side of his vehicle followed by two officers with guns drawn. The closest officer tried to grab Blake, and when Blake opened the door and leaned in, that officer grabbed him and fired at least seven shots towards Blake's back.

Blake was flown to Froedtert Hospital. His father announced on August 25 that Blake was paralyzed from the waist down and that doctors do not know if the injury will be permanent.

Kenosha police referred the investigation of the shooting to the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation. As part of the process, findings from the investigation will go to District Attorney Michael D. Graveley, the local official responsible for deciding to bring charges against the officers. Graveley stated on August 25 that the investigation was in "its earliest stages".

The family of Jacob Blake has retained attorney Benjamin Crump, who also represented the families of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown in their civil suits.

Protests followed, leading the Kenosha County government to declare a state of emergency overnight on August 24 after police vehicles were damaged, a dump truck was set on fire, and the local courthouse was vandalized. One officer was knocked unconscious and transported to a hospital after being hit in the head with a brick, and tear gas was deployed. Police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of what it alleged were "numerous" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers deployed the Wisconsin National Guard to maintain public safety after the shooting. Up to 200 members will be deployed. On August 24, the rioters and protestors set fires and looted businesses for a second night.



Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued a statement denouncing the excessive use of force by police and invoking the names of African Americans killed by law enforcement. Evers said, "While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country."

Evers called Wisconsin state lawmakers into a special session to pass legislation addressing police brutality.

Presidential candidate Joe Biden said, "these shots pierce the soul of our nation".
