Jacob S. Blake is a 29-year-old African-American man who was hit by four of seven shots fired towards his back during an arrest by Rusten Sheskey, a Kenosha, Wisconsin, police officer. The incident occurred on August 23, 2020, as police officers were attempting to arrest Blake over a domestic violence dispute. During the encounter, Blake was unsuccessfully tasered and scuffled with officers. As Blake opened the driver’s seat door to his SUV and leaned into the vehicle he was shot several times by an officer. Three of Blake's sons were in the backseat of the SUV.

The shooting was followed by protests, property damage, and arson in downtown Kenosha, and further clashes with riot police. Blake's name was invoked in protests in other cities as part of the Black Lives Matter movement, which had seen a resurgence in the wake of high-profile police killings in 2020.

Blake had an active arrest warrant issued on July 6, 2020, related to charges of third-degree sexual assault, trespassing, and disorderly conduct; in connection with domestic abuse.

Kenosha police responded to a 9-1-1 call in which the dispatcher reported that "a complainant said Blake wasn't supposed to be there, and that he had taken the complainant's keys and refused to give them back". According to a witness, Blake had pulled his car up near "six or seven women shouting at each other on the sidewalk" and "Blake did not say anything to the women". Blake's attorney, Benjamin Crump, said Blake "was attempting to de-escalate a fight between two other people when officers arrived at the scene", and that Blake tried to enter his vehicle to check on his three sons inside.

Officers attempted to subdue Blake, and used a taser on him. A bystander who recorded a video of the incident heard police yelling "drop the knife", and also said, "I didn't see any weapons in his hands, he wasn't being violent". After an initial scuffle, Blake got away and walked to the driver side of his vehicle followed by Sheskey and another officer with guns drawn. Sheskey tried to grab Blake, and when Blake opened the door and leaned in, Sheskey grabbed him and fired seven shots towards Blake's back. Crump said Blake was hit by four of the seven bullets. The Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul told a press conference on August 26, 2020 that a knife was recovered on the driver's side floor of Blake's vehicle, and Blake had admitted to investigators that he had a knife.

Blake was flown to Froedtert Hospital in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. His father announced on August 25 that Blake was paralyzed from the waist down and that doctors do not know if the injury will be permanent.

Kenosha police referred the investigation of the shooting to the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation. As part of the process, findings from the investigation will go to District Attorney Michael D. Graveley, the local official responsible for deciding to bring charges against the officers. Graveley stated on August 25 that the investigation was in "its earliest stages". On August 25, the United States Department of Justice also announced an investigation into the shooting. The investigation will look into whether Blake's civil rights were violated.

Blake's family retained Crump, who also represented the families of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown in their civil suits. Crump has called for the officer who opened fire to be arrested and others involved to lose their jobs, and also said that it would "take a miracle" for Blake to walk again.

On August 26, Wisconsin's attorney general Josh Kaul announced that Kenosha police officer Rusten Sheskey had shot Blake seven times in the back as he opened the door of his car. No other officers at the scene fired, but all have now been placed on administrative leave.

Protests followed, leading the Kenosha County government to declare a state of emergency overnight on August 24 after police vehicles were damaged, a dump truck was set on fire, and the local courthouse was vandalized. A video posted by a local newspaper appeared to show an officer being knocked down with a brick, and tear gas was deployed. Police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of what it alleged were "numerous" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers deployed the Wisconsin National Guard to maintain public safety after the shooting. Up to 200 members were planned to be deployed. On August 24, the protestors set fires and looted businesses for a second night. On August 25, 2020 the protests and fires continued throughout Kenosha. Citizens armed with long guns occupied parts of the city. A 17-year-old white male who was part of that group shot three protestors, killing two. The shooter was later arrested in Antioch, Illinois, on a charge of first degree murder.



Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued a statement denouncing the excessive use of force by police and invoking the names of African Americans killed by law enforcement. Evers said, "While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country."

Evers called Wisconsin state lawmakers into a special session to pass legislation addressing police brutality.

Former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said, "these shots pierce the soul of our nation".

On August 24, in New York City 700 protesters marched from Times Square to Brooklyn to condemn the shooting and calls for defunding the police. Metal barriers were erected to prevent protesters from crossing the Brooklyn Bridge; however, 300 protesters jumped them.

In the NBA Bubble, the Milwaukee Bucks boycotted their August 26 first-round playoff game against the Orlando Magic in protest of the shooting. The team decided not to come out of their locker room minutes before the scheduled start to the game. Later that day, the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association announced that in light of the Bucks’ decision to refuse to play, all NBA games for the day were postponed. The Toronto Raptors have also discussed a boycott of their second-round playoff series with the Boston Celtics in frustration with a lack of social or legislative change after George Floyd's death and as a result of Blake's shooting.

On August 26, the game between the Milwaukee Brewers and Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball was postponed in protest. It was later announced that the Seattle Mariners-San Diego Padres and the Los Angeles Dodgers-San Francisco Giants games scheduled for that evening were also being postponed.

On August 26, Major League Soccer players boycotted five games in a collective statement against racial injustice. Players from games between Atlanta United and Inter Miami, FC Dallas and Colorado Rapids, Portland Timbers and San Jose Earthquakes, Real Salt Lake and LAFC, and LA Galaxy and Seattle Sounders did not play.

All three WNBA games scheduled for August 26 were also postponed.

On August 26, Naomi Osaka announced she would boycott the Cincinnati Masters semifinals as part of the protest following the shooting of Jacob Blake.
