Edward Colston (1636 &ndash; 1721) was a Bristol based English merchant. He was a member of the Royal African Company, which held the sole government grant for slave trading in the late 1600s.

A statue was erected in Bristol in 1895 commemorating Colston. He was widely viewed as an inspirational figure for the city, due to his philanthropy, donating vast sums of money to schools and other causes. His name permeates the city in such landmarks as the Colston Tower, Colston Hall, Colston Hill and in school names as well. Colston is a controversial figure these days in Bristol. In the 1990s, knowledge of his participation in the slave trade grew. Bristol band Massive Attack refused to play at Colston Hall, and his statue has been repeatedly defaced and vandalised.
