Marjorie Greene is an American politician from the state of Georgia. She is a Republican candidate in the 2020 elections seeking to represent in the United States House of Representatives.

Greene began her 2020 candidacy in, but shifted her campaign to the 14th district after incumbent Tom Graves announced he would not run for reelection. In the days before the primary election, Facebook took down a Greene advertisement in which she brandished an AR-15.
