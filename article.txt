On August 23, 2020, Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old unarmed black man, was shot seven times by a Kenosha, Wisconsin police officer as he was getting inside of his vehicle. Protests and rioting occurred in response, as part of the larger Black Lives Matter movement which had seen a resurgence in the wake of high profile police killings in 2020, including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.

Witnesses allege that Blake had been attempting to break up a fight between two women. It is unknown what lead to the police interacting with Blake, but it is reported that they attempted to subdue him with a taser. Video spread on social media shows Blake surrounded by police with their weapons already drawn. Blake ignores their demands, walking around his vehicle and attempting to enter it. As he does, one police officer grabs him and begins firing his weapon into Blake's back. Blake's attorney said that Blake's three sons were inside the vehicle at the time. Blake was left in serious condition and flown to a hospital.

Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued a statement denouncing the excessive use of force by police and invoking the names of African Americans killed by law enforcement.

Protests and riots erupted, leading the Kenosha police to declare a state of emergency. Police vehicles were damaged and a dump truck was set on fire. One officer was hit in the head with a flying object. Tear gas was deployed by the police.
