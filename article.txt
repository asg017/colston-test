Kamala Devi Harris (born October 20, 1964, in Oakland, California) is the current District Attorney of San Francisco. She was first elected in 2003, defeating incumbent district attorney Terence Hallinan. She was re-elected in 2007. She was also cited by the New York Times to be among the seventeen most likely women to become the first female President of the United States. She is currently a candidate for California Attorney General. If elected, she would be the first woman and first person of color elected Attorney General of California.

Harris attended the historically African American college, Howard University in Washington, D.C. and received a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from University of California, Hastings College of the Law in 1989. She is the daughter of an Tamil Indian mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer specialist, who immigrated to the United States from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India in 1960, and a Jamaican American father, Stanford University economics professor Donald Harris.

Harris served as Deputy District Attorney in Alameda County, California from 1990 to 1998. She then became Managing Attorney of the Career Criminal Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office. In 2000, San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne recruited her to join the her office, where she was Chief of the Community and Neighborhood Division, which oversees civil code enforcement matters.

In 2004, The National Urban League honored Harris as a "Woman of Power" and she received the Thurgood Marshall Award from the National Black Prosecutors Association in 2005. The Los Angeles Daily Journal recognized Harris as one of the top 100 lawyers in California. Additionally, she has served on the boards of several community organizations.

Harris ran unopposed for re-election in 2007. She has received acclaim from some for increasing conviction rates over previous DA, Terence Hallinan (whose conviction rate was 52% versus the 83% state-wide average). However, San Francisco still has the lowest incarceration rate in the state of California. While Harris has also faced criticism in the face of continuing poor relations with police and rising violent crime rates, she has been called a front-runner in her campaign for Attorney General of California in 2010.

Harris is a member of the Democratic Party.

Harris is personally opposed to the death penalty, but has said that she would review each case individually. However, her position was tested in April 2004, when police officer Isaac Espinoza was murdered in the Bayview district. Harris announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing. While the decision sparked protests from the police officers union, Sen. Diane Feinstein, and others, many in San Francisco supported the decision. Those who supported the decision included actor Mike Farrell, San Francisco Supervisors Tom Ammiano and Sophie Maxwell, in whose Bayview district the murder occurred.

Harris' position against the death penalty was tested again in the case of Edwin Ramos, an undocumented immigrant and alleged MS13 gang-member who allegedly murdered Tony Bologna, 48, and his sons Michael, 20, and Matthew, 16. The family was allegedly murdered by Ramos, who had been arrested just a month earlier with a gun that had been used in a murder, but the DA's office had declined to press charges. On September 10, 2009 Harris announced she would seek "life in prison without the possibility of parole," rather than the death penalty in the Ramos case. . There is currently a lawsuit by the family against the city of San Francisco that claims the city contributed to the deaths of Danielle Bologna’s husband, Anthony Bologna, and two of their sons, through its sanctuary city policy. A judge has recently ruled that the family can sue San Francisco in state court.

As San Francisco District Attorney, Harris has taken a hard-line stance against perpetrators of violent crimes and felons. She raised the overall felony conviction rate from 52% in 2003 to 67% in 2006, the highest in a decade, secured an 85% conviction rate for homicides, and increased convictions of drug dealers from 56% in 2003 to 74% in 2006. She has also prosecuted gun crimes and gang violence with much success. She increased the number of gun cases taken to trial and doubled the conviction rate in felony gun trials, from 43% in 2003 to 90% in 2006 and has put 216 gang members behind bars.

Harris has also taken a hard-line stance against perpetrators of gender-based violence, human trafficking, sex offenses, child assault, and domestic violence. She co-Sponsored the California Trafficking Victims Protection Act, created a Child Assault Unit in the District Attorney's Office, raised the conviction rate in domestic violence trials, increased prison time for sex offenses against children, and led the creation efforts for San Francisco's first Safe House for sexually exploited youth.

In 2009, Harris wrote Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor's Plan to Make Us Safer. . She has been outspoken on the need for innovation in public safety. While some challenge her programs as "soft on crime," the programs are designed to reduce the recidivism rate in San Francisco. One such program, "Back on Track" was signed into law by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as a model program for the state. While there have been some issues with removing undocumented immigrants from the program, it has since been revised to address this concern.

Harris has long been concerned with civil rights issues, creating a special Hate Crimes Unit as San Francisco District Attorney. She is especially concerned with hate crimes against LGBT children and teens in schools. She convened a national conference to confront the "gay-transgender panic defense," which has been used to justify violent hate crimes. Harris supports same-sex marriage in California, opposing both Proposition 22 and Proposition 8.

Harris has also had along history supporting civil rights for people of color and women. In her campaign for California Attorney General, she has received the endorsements of numerous community groups, including EMILY's List, California Legislative Black Caucus, Asian American Action Fund, Black Women Organized for Political Action, Mexican American Bar Association, South Asians for Opportunity, and the National Women's Political Caucus.

In interviews with Matt Lauer on the Today Show and local KGO-TV, Harris argued for treating "habitually and chronic truancy" among children in elementary school as a crime committed by the parents of truant children. She has received the endorsement of the California Federation of Teachers.

In her campaign for California Attorney General, Harris has received the endorsements of United Farm Workers Co-Founder Dolores Huerta, United Educators of San Francisco, and the San Francisco Firefighters Local 798.

During her time as San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created the Environmental Justice Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office and has prosecuted several industries and individuals for pollution, most notably U-Haul, Alameda Publishing Corporation, and the Cosco Busan oil spill. She has also advocated for strong enforcement of environmental protection laws.

Harris has prosecuted numerous financial crimes throughout her career, particularly those affecting elders, high-tech crime, and identity theft.
