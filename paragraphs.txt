Marjorie Taylor Greene is an American politician and businesswoman from the state of Georgia. She is the Republican nominee in the 2020 elections seeking to represent in the United States House of Representatives.
Greene graduated from the University of Georgia. She and her husband, Perry, have owned Taylor Commercial, a construction company, since 2002.
Greene began her 2020 candidacy in, but shifted her campaign to the 14th district after incumbent Tom Graves announced he would not run for reelection. In the days before the primary election, Facebook took down a Greene advertisement in which she brandished an AR-15 for violating its terms of service. She finished in first place in the primary election, and will face John Cowan in the runoff election. Greene supports the QAnon conspiracy theory. After the first round of the election, Politico unearthed videos published by Greene where she expressed racist, anti-Semetic, and Islamophobic views, which led to condemnations from Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise. Greene defeated Cowan to win the nomination on August 11.
