Harris served as a deputy [[district attorney]] in [[Alameda County, California]], from 1990 to 1998. Harris says she sought a career in law enforcement because she wanted to be "at the table where decisions are made."<ref name=NYTmag/>  After 1998, while [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]] was San Francisco's mayor, she became managing attorney of the Career Criminal Unit in the [[San Francisco District Attorney's Office]]. In 2000, San Francisco [[City Attorney]] [[Louise Renne]] recruited Harris to join her office, where she was chief of the Community and Neighborhood Division, which oversees civil [[code enforcement]] matters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womensradio.com/articles/This-DA-Makes-a-Difference-for-Women/559.html |title=Women's Radio: This DA Makes a Difference For Women |publisher=Womensradio.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> Recognized by The ''[[The Daily Journal Corporation|Los Angeles Daily Journal]]'' as one of the top 100 lawyers in California, she served on the board of the California District Attorney's Association and was vice president of the National District Attorneys Association.<ref name="nomination">{{cite news|title=Kamala Harris wins Dem nomination for California AG|url=http://www.zeenews.com/news632777.html|accessdate=August 19, 2010|newspaper=Z News|date=June 9, 2010}}</ref>

=== District Attorney of the City and County of San Francisco ===
[[File:Congresswoman Pelosi meets San Francisco's District Attorney, Kamala Harris; March 30, 2004.jpg|thumb|left|Harris meets with [[Nancy Pelosi]] in 2004]]
After the [[Fajitagate]] scandal, Harris defeated two-term incumbent [[Terence Hallinan]] in the [[San Francisco mayoral election, 2003|2003 election]] to become [[San Francisco District Attorney's Office|District Attorney of the City and County of San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Nina|title=Why Kamala Matters|url=http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/why-kamala-matters|accessdate=12 May 2015|work=San Francisco Magazine|date=August 2007}}</ref>

In April 2004, [[San Francisco Police Department]] Officer Isaac Espinoza was shot and killed in the line of duty.<ref name=NYTmag/>  Three days later D.A. Harris announced she would not seek the [[death penalty]], infuriating the [[San Francisco Police Officers Association]].<ref name=NYTmag/>  During Officer Espinoza's funeral at [[Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption (San Francisco, California)|St. Mary's Cathedral]] U.S. Senator and former San Francisco mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] rose to the pulpit and called on Harris, who was sitting in the front pew, to secure the death penalty, prompting a standing ovation from the 2,000 uniformed police officers in attendance.<ref name=NYTmag/>  Harris still refused.<ref name=NYTmag/> Officer Espinoza's killer was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.<ref name=NYTmag/>

As D.A., Harris started a program that gives first-time drug dealers the chance to earn a high school diploma and find employment.<ref name=NYTmag/>  Over eight years the program produced fewer than 300 graduates, but achieved a very low [[recidivism]] rate.<ref name=NYTmag/>  She was re-elected when she ran unopposed, in 2007.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite news|title=Kamala Harris celebrates unopposed bid for district attorney|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-11-07/news/17271686_1_harris-job-training-terence-hallinan|accessdate=February 2, 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 7, 2007|first=Heather|last=Knight}}</ref>

==== Violent crimes, felons, incarceration, and conviction rate ====
While Harris was the San Francisco District Attorney, the overall [[felony]] conviction rate rose from 52% in 2003 to 67% in 2006, the highest in a decade; there was an 85% conviction rate for homicides, and convictions of drug dealers increased from 56% in 2003 to 74% in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kamalaharris.org/issues/34 |title=Convicting Felons - Kamala Harris |date=January 3, 2008 |publisher= |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103072145/http://www.kamalaharris.org/issues/34 |archivedate=January 3, 2008 |df= }}</ref> While these statistics represent only trial convictions, she also closed many cases via [[plea bargain]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/a-lack-of-conviction/Content?oid=2177022|title=A Lack of Conviction|date=May 5, 2010|work=[[SF Weekly]]|author=Peter Jamison}}</ref> When she took office, she took a special interest in clearing part of the murder caseload from the previous administration. Harris claimed that the records were less than optimal from the previous administration, and worked to get convictions on what she could. That meant that out of the 73 homicide cases backlogged, 32 cases took deals for lesser charges such as [[manslaughter]] or took pleas to other crimes such as assault or burglary while the murder charges were dismissed.<ref>Van Derbeken, Jaxon.

However, critics argue that San Francisco sends fewer people to jail per arrest than other counties throughout the state. The San Francisco DA's incarceration rates were among the lowest in the entire state of California—fully ten times lower than in San Diego County, for example. According to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', "roughly 4 of every 100 arrests resulted in prison terms in San Francisco, compared with 12.8 out of 100 in Alameda County, 14.4 of 100 in Sacramento County, 21 of 100 in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, 26.6 of 100 in Fresno County, 38.7 of 100 in Los Angeles County and 41 of 100 in San Diego County."<ref name="Police1">{{cite web|url=http://www.policeone.com/community-policing/articles/1203289-San-Francisco-chief-calls-justice-system-too-lenient/|title=San Francisco chief calls justice system too lenient|date=January 14, 2007|publisher=Policeone.com|author=ITT Night Vision|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> Police also noted that lenient sentencing from San Francisco judges also played a role in this.<ref name="Police1" />

While officers within the SFPD credited Harris with tightening loopholes in bail and drug programs that defendants had exploited in the past, they also accused her of being too deliberate in her prosecution of murder suspects.<ref>Van Derbeken, Jaxon. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/03/20/MNG01HQVPA1.DTL#ixzz0jKyN3hF9 "Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', March 20, 2006.</ref> Additionally, in 2009 San Francisco prosecutors won a lower percentage of their felony jury trials than their counterparts at district attorneys' offices covering the 10 largest cities in California, according to data on case outcomes compiled by officials at the San Francisco Superior Court as well as by other county courts and prosecutors. (Officials in Sacramento, the sixth-largest city in California, did not provide data.) Harris's at-trial felony conviction rate that year was 76%, down 12 points from the previous year.

In 2012, Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo ruled that San Francisco District Attorney Harris' office violated defendants' rights by hiding damaging information about a police crime lab technician, and was indifferent to demands that it account for its failings.<ref name="SFVanDerbeken">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/05/21/BAN01DHVMU.DTL#ixzz0od05q8Qb|title=Judge rips Harris' office for hiding problems|last=Van Derbeken|first=Jaxon|date=May 21, 2010|work=SF Gate|accessdate=July 28, 2010}}</ref>

==== Hate crimes and civil rights ====
Harris created a special Hate Crimes Unit as San Francisco District Attorney. She focused on hate crimes against [[LGBT]] children and teens in schools.

Harris announced her intention to run for re-election in February 2014, and filed paperwork to run on February 12. According to the office of [[California Secretary of State]] [[Debra Bowen]], Harris had raised the money for her campaign during the previous year in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2014/02/14/kamala-harris-announces-bid-re-election-gop-scratching-heads-candidate-face/|title=As Kamala Harris announces bid for re-election, GOP scratching their heads for a candidate to face her|work=The American Blazer|first=Deepak|last=Chitnis|date=February 14, 2014}}</ref> On August 13, 2014, she announced her endorsement of [[Betty Yee]] for [[California State Controller]], called her one of the state's "most knowledgeable and responsible money managers," and said she was proud to endorse her.

In September 2014, when [[US Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] announced his intention to step down, Harris was speculated as being a potential candidate as the next US Attorney General.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/09/25/eric-holder-attorney-general-replacements/16203345/ | title=After Eric Holder: Potential attorney general choices | work=[[USA Today]] | date=September 25, 2014 | accessdate=September 25, 2014 | author=Camia, Catalina}}</ref> Harris addressed the speculation in a statement, days after Holder's resignation, declining an intent to take the office and asserted she was staying in her position as [[Attorney General of California]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article2611980.html|title=California AG Kamala Harris says she's staying put|work=The Sacramento Bee|date=September 25, 2014|first=Christopher|last=Cadelago|accessdate= November 16, 2014}}</ref> Two months later, in November 2014, President [[Barack Obama]] nominated [[Loretta Lynch]] to succeed Holder.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/08/us/politics/loretta-lynch-eric-holder-attorney-general.html | title = Loretta Lynch, Federal Prosecutor, Will Be Nominated for Attorney General | work =The New York Times | date = November 7, 2014 | accessdate = November 16, 2014}}</ref> On November 10, Harris issued a statement regarding the nomination that approved of Obama's decision, praised Lynch, and reaffirmed her choice to remain working with the California Department of Justice.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highlandnews.net/news/top_stories/article_feedbebc-68ee-11e4-a193-831caeadfb97.html|title=Attorney General Kamala D.

=== Tenure as California Attorney General ===

====Housing====
When Harris took office, California was still reeling from the effects of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. Harris participated in the National Mortgage Settlement against five banks: [[Ally Financial]], [[Wells Fargo]], [[Bank of America]], [[Citibank]], and [[Chase (bank)|Chase]]. She originally walked off the talks because she believed the deal was too lenient. She later rejoined the talks, securing $12 billion of debt reduction for the state's homeowners and $26 billion overall.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Kamala-Harris-foreclosure-deal-a-win-for-state-3381270.php | title=Kamala Harris' foreclosure deal a win for state | date=March 5, 2012 | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | author1=Parker, Barbara | author2=Rebecca Kaplan | accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> Other parts of the funding would go to state housing counseling services and legal help for struggling homeowners and forgiving the debt of over 23,000 homeowners who agreed to sell their homes for less than the mortgage loan.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/12/business/la-fi-0512-harris-housing-20120512 | title=Mortgage deal cash is divvied | date=May 12, 2012 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Lazo, Alejandro | accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref>

Later, she introduced the California Homeowner's Bill of Rights in the [[California State Legislature]], a package of several bills that would give homeowners more "options when fighting to keep their home". The Bill, which took effect on January 1, 2013, banned the practices of "dual-tracking" (processing a modification and foreclosure at the same time) and [[robo-signing]], and provided homeowners with a single point of contact at their lending institution. It also gave the California Attorney General more power to investigate and prosecute financial fraud and to convene special [[grand jury|grand juries]] to prosecute multi-county crimes instead of prosecuting a single crime county-by-county.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-passage-bills-california-homeowner | title=Attorney General Kamala D.

==== Prison conditions and sentencing reform ====
After the United States Supreme Court in ''[[Brown v. Plata]]'' (2011) declared California's prisons so overcrowded they inflicted [[cruel and unusual punishment]], Harris fought federal court supervision, explaining "I have a client, and I don't get to choose my client."<ref name="NYTmag" /> After California failed to fully implement the court's order to reduce crowding, and was ordered to implement new parole programs, lawyers for Kamala Harris appealed the decision on grounds that if forced to release these inmates early, prisons would lose an important labor pool.<ref>{{cite news|last1=St. John|first1=Paige|title=Federal judges order California to expand prison releases|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-ff-federal-judges-order-state-to-release-more-prisoners-20141114-story.html|access-date=October 12, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 14, 2014}}</ref>

Harris refused to take any position on criminal sentencing-reform initiatives [[California Proposition 36, 2012|Proposition 36 (2012)]] and [[California Proposition 47 (2014)|Proposition 47 (2014)]], arguing it would be improper because her office prepares the ballot booklets.<ref name="NYTmag" /> Former California Attorney General [[John Van de Kamp]] considered her explanation "baloney".<ref name="NYTmag" />

==== Daniel Larsen case ====
On August 24, 2012, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published an editorial calling on Harris to release Daniel Larsen from prison.<ref name="LATimes">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/24/opinion/la-ed-larsen-20120824|title=Daniel Larsen should be freed from prison, whatever it takes|date=August 24, 2012|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}</ref> Larsen, who was sentenced to 28 years to life under California's [[three strikes laws]] for possession of a [[concealed weapon]] in 1999, was declared "[[actually innocent]]" by a federal judge in 2009 and ordered released. Evidence in favor of Larsen included that of a former chief of police and the actual owner of the knife; Larsen's original lawyer, who failed to call a single witness, has since been disbarred.<ref name="NYDN">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/daniel-larsen-innocent-california-prisoner-freed-13-years-behind-bars-article-1.1293456|title=Daniel Larsen, ‘innocent’ California prisoner, freed after 13 years behind bars|date=March 19, 2013|work=[[NY Daily News]]|accessdate=January 14, 2015|author=Knowles, David}}</ref> Larsen remained in prison because Harris's office objected to his release on the grounds that he missed the deadline to file his [[writ of habeas corpus]]. The [[California Innocence Project]], which had taken up Larsen's case, said this amounted to a paperwork technicality. The ''Times'' editorial stated that if Harris was not willing to release Larsen, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] should pardon him. In March 2013, Larsen was released on [[Surety bond|bond]] with the case on appeal by order of Attorney General Harris "on technical grounds".<ref name="NYDN" /> In September 2013, the [[Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals]] upheld the ruling, and on January 27, 2014, the [[Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office]] dismissed the charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=4350|title=Daniel Larsen|date=January 27, 2014|publisher=[[National Registry of Exonerations]]|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref>

==== Michelle-Lael Norsworthy case ====

In February 2014, Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, a transgender woman incarcerated at California's [[Mule Creek State Prison]], filed a federal lawsuit based on the state's failure to provide her with what she argued was medically necessary [[sex reassignment surgery]] (SRS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20Adv%20FDCO%20151116-000237/NORSWORTHY%20v.%20BEARD|title=Jeffrey B.

==== County prosecutors' misconduct ====
In 2015, Harris defended convictions obtained by county prosecutors who had inserted a false confession into an interrogation transcript, committed perjury, and withheld evidence.<ref name="NYTmag" /> Federal appeals court Judge [[Alex Kozinski]] threw out the convictions, telling Harris's lawyers, "Talk to the attorney general and make sure she understands the gravity of the situation."<ref name="NYTmag" />

In March 2015 a [[California superior courts]] judge ordered Harris to take over a criminal case after [[Orange County, California]] District Attorney [[Tony Rackauckas]] was revealed to have illegally employed jailhouse informants and concealed evidence.<ref name="NYTmag" />  Harris refused, appealing the order and defending Rackauckas.<ref name="NYTmag" />

Harris appealed the dismissal of an indictment when it was discovered a [[Kern County, California]] prosecutor perjured in submitting a falsified confession as court evidence. Harris asserted that prosecutorial perjury was not sufficient to demonstrate prosecutorial misconduct. In the case,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2781830/people-v-velasco-palacios-ca5/|title=People v.

Hill was given the maximum sentence for the conviction, [[life without the possibility of parole]].<ref name="SF Sentinel" />

Harris's position against the death penalty was tested again in the case of [[Edwin Ramos]], an [[undocumented immigrant]] and alleged [[MS-13]] gang member who was accused of murdering Tony Bologna and his sons Michael and Matthew.<ref name="latimes.com">Finnegan, Michael.

Harris has expressed the belief that life without possibility of parole is a better, and more cost-effective, punishment.<ref name="CA Capitol">{{cite web|url=http://californiascapitol.com/blog/?p=341 |title=San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris |publisher=Californiascapitol.com |date=April 15, 2009 |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> According to the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, the death penalty conservatively costs $137 million per year.<ref name="CCAFJ report">{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfaj.org/documents/CCFAJFinalReport.pdf |title=CCFAJ-Report-final.pdf |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114144752/http://www.ccfaj.org/documents/CCFAJFinalReport.pdf |archive-date=November 14, 2010}}</ref> If the system were changed to life without possibility of parole, the annual costs would be approximately $12 million per year.<ref name="CCAFJ report" /> Harris noted that the resulting surplus could put 1,000 more police officers into service in San Francisco alone.<ref name="CA Capitol" />

When in 2014, U.S. District Judge [[Cormac J. Carney]] declared [[capital punishment in California]] unconstitutional, Harris reviewed the case.<ref name=NYTmag/>

While serving as district attorney in San Francisco, Harris, along with other district attorneys, filed an [[amicus brief]] in ''[[District of Columbia v.
