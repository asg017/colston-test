==== Felony conviction rate ====
Harris inherited a 50% felony conviction rate from Hallinan when she took over in 2004.

==== Violent crimes ====
In the early 2000s, the [[City and County of San Francisco]] murder rate per capita drastically outpaced the national average. Within the first six months of taking office, Harris cleared 27 of 74 backlogged homicide cases by settling 14 by [[plea bargain]] and taking 11 to trial; with 9 convictions and 2 hung juries, she attained an 81% success rate. She took 49 violent crime cases to trial and secured 36 convictions, for an 84% success rate.<ref>{{cite news|first=Alison|last=Soltau|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/462412693/?terms=kamala%2Bharris%2Bconviction%2Brate|title=New DA claims higher success rate vs. violent felons|newspaper=[[San Francisco Examiner]]|date=July 21, 2004|page=4|accessdate=May 20, 2020}}</ref> From 2004 to 2006, Harris achieved an 87% conviction rate for homicides and a 90% conviction rate for all felony gun violations.<ref>{{cite news|first=Bonnie|last=Eslinger|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/462434036/?terms=kamala%2Bharris%2Bconviction%2Brate|title=SF's Felony conviction rate improves|newspaper=[[San Francisco Examiner]]|date=September 15, 2006|page=4|accessdate=May 20, 2020}}</ref>

Harris also pushed for higher bail for criminal [[defendant]]s involved in gun-related crimes, arguing that historically low [[bail]] encouraged outsiders to commit crimes in San Francisco. [[San Francisco Police Department|SFPD officers]] credited Harris with tightening [[loophole]]s in bail and drug programs that defendants had used in the past.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jaxon|last=Van Derbeken|url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Trials-and-tribulations-of-Kamala-Harris-D-A-2521498.php |title=Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=March 20, 2006|accessdate=March 9, 2019}}</ref> In addition to creating a gun crime unit, Harris opposed releasing defendants on their own recognizance if they were arrested on gun crimes, sought minimum 90-day sentences for possession of concealed or loaded weapons, and charged all assault weapons possession cases as felonies, adding that she would seek prison terms for criminals who possessed or used assault weapons and would seek maximum penalties on gun-related crimes:<ref name="Garofoli">{{cite news|last=Garofoli|first=Joe |url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/joegarofoli/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-D-A-vows-to-go-after-gun-law-2755194.php |title=D.A. vows to go after gun law violators / Harris takes tough approach, pledges maximum penalties|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=May 29, 2004|accessdate=May 2, 2020}}</ref>

In April 2005, Harris pursued the prosecution of Charles Rothenberg, a.k.a. Charley Charles, under California's [[three strikes law]] for illegal possession of a firearm. Rothenberg became infamous in the 1980s when he set his 6-year-old son, [[Dave Dave]], on fire amidst a custody dispute with his ex-wife. Rothenberg previously served 6{{frac|1|2}} years in prison for dousing the hotel room in kerosene and setting it ablaze while his son was asleep. Having been convicted of attempted murder and arson, and now illegal firearm possession, Rothenberg's act constituted a third "strike" under state law, triggering a sentence of 25 years to life in prison.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marisa |last=Lagos |url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Rothenberg-sentenced-25-years-to-life-under-2567011.php |title=Rothenberg sentenced 25 years to life under three-strike law |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=April 4, 2007 }}</ref>

In August 2007, state assemblyman [[Mark Leno]] introduced legislation to ban gun shows at the [[Cow Palace]], joined by Harris, Police Chief [[Heather Fong]], and Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]]. City leaders contended the shows were directly contributing to the proliferation of illegal guns and spiking homicide rates in San Francisco: Mayor Newsom earlier that month signed into law local legislation banning gun shows on city and county property.

The program maintained rigorous graduation requirements, mandating completion of up to 220 hours of community service, obtaining a [[High school equivalency degree|high-school-equivalency diploma]], maintaining steady employment, taking parenting classes, and passing drug tests.

====Truancy initiative====
In 2006, as part of an initiative to reduce the city's skyrocketing homicide rate, Harris led a city-wide effort to combat [[truancy]] for at-risk elementary school youth in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite news|first=Heather|last=Knight|title=City opens campaign to cut truancy by thousands of students|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=105D3AF9CE92404E&p_docnum=16&s_dlid=DL0120050214473400976&s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&s_trackval=&s_siteloc=&s_referrer=&s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F15%2F2030&s_docsbal=%20&s_subexpires=12%2F15%2F2030&s_docstart=&s_docsleft=&s_docsread=&s_username=refuser&s_accountid=AC0114070818394531470&s_upgradeable=no|accessdate=May 1, 2020 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 19, 2004}}</ref> Declaring chronic truancy a matter of public safety and pointing out that the majority of prison inmates and homicide victims are dropouts or habitual truants, Harris's office met with thousands of parents at high-risk schools and sent out letters warning all families of the legal consequences of truancy at the beginning of the fall semester, adding she would prosecute the parents of chronically truant elementary students; penalties included a $2,500 fine and up to a year in jail.<ref name="Knight">{{cite news|first=Heather|last=Knight|title=City trying to get worst truants to school.

In 2008, Harris issued citations against six parents whose children missed at least 50 days of school, the first time San Francisco prosecuted adults for student truancy. San Francisco's school chief, Carlos Garcia, stated that the path from truancy to prosecution was lengthy, and that the school district usually spends months encouraging parents through phone calls, reminder letters, private meetings, hearings before the School Attendance Review Board, and offers of help from city agencies and social services; two of the six parents entered no plea but said they would work with the DA's office and social service agencies to create "parental responsibility plans" to help them start sending their children to school regularly.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nanette|last=Asimov|title=Citations go to parents of truant kids|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=1213DEC077C76F28&p_docnum=9&s_dlid=DL0120050214581526325&s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&s_trackval=&s_siteloc=&s_referrer=&s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F15%2F2030&s_docsbal=%20&s_subexpires=12%2F15%2F2030&s_docstart=&s_docsleft=&s_docsread=&s_username=refuser&s_accountid=AC0114070818394531470&s_upgradeable=no|accessdate=May 2, 2020 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 11, 2008}}</ref> By April 2009, there were 1,330 elementary school students who were habitual or chronic truants, down 23% from 1,730 in 2008, and down from 2,517 in 2007 and from 2,856 in 2006.<ref name="SFGate">{{cite news|title=Fighting truancy yields big dividends |url=https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Fighting-truancy-yields-big-dividends-3295152.php|accessdate=May 2, 2020 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 14, 2009}}</ref> Harris's office prosecuted seven parents in three years, with none jailed.<ref name="SFGate"/>

{{main|2010 California Attorney General election}}
[[File:Kamala Harris Official Attorney General Photo.jpg|thumb|Official Attorney General portrait]]
On November 12, 2008, Harris announced her candidacy for [[California Attorney General|California attorney general]]. Both of California's senators, [[Dianne Feinstein]] and [[Barbara Boxer]], House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]], [[United Farm Workers]] cofounder [[Dolores Huerta]], and Mayor of Los Angeles [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] all endorsed her during the primary.<ref name="newsline">{{cite news|url=http://www.legalnewsline.com/news/226664-villaraigosa-eschews-local-candidates-backs-harris-for-calif.-attorney-general|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723184208/http://www.legalnewsline.com/news/226664-villaraigosa-eschews-local-candidates-backs-harris-for-calif.-attorney-general|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 23, 2011|title=Villaraigosa eschews local candidates, backs Harris for Calif. attorney general|last=Rizo|first=Chris|date=April 16, 2010|newspaper=Legal Newsline|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}</ref> In the June 8, 2010 primary, she was nominated with 33.6% of the vote, defeating [[Alberto Torrico]] and [[Chris Kelly (entrepreneur)|Chris Kelly]].<ref name="StatementofVote2010Primary">{{cite web |url=https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2010-primary/pdf/2010-complete-sov.pdf |accessdate=April 22, 2020 |title=Statement of Vote June 8, 2010, Direct Primary Election |work=California Secretary of State }}</ref>

In the general election, she faced Republican [[Los Angeles County]] district attorney [[Steve Cooley]], who led most of the race. Cooley ran as a nonpartisan, distancing himself from the [[2010 California gubernatorial election|Meg Whitman campaign]]. However, during a debate on October 5, Cooley complained about the low salary of the attorney general, stating his intention to accept a pension and the salary in a practice known as "double-dipping". Harris turned his remarks into a cutting political ad that portrayed him as out-of-touch.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.laweekly.com/how-steve-cooley-blew-it-the-definitive-post-mortem/ |first=Gene |last=Maddaus |title=How Steve Cooley blew it: The definitive post-mortem |work=LA Weekly|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref>

On election night, November 2, 2010, Cooley declared victory, but mail-in and provisional ballots remained uncounted, with the lead changing four times. On November 24, as the count advanced, Harris led by more than 55,000 votes. Cooley conceded the next day.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/11/steve-cooley-kamala-harris-attorney-general.html |first=Jack |last=Leonard |title=Kamala Harris wins attorney general's race as Steve Cooley concedes|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref>

=== Significant cases and policies ===
==== Anti-truancy efforts ====
[[File:Attorney General Kamala Harris visits Peterson Middle School to discuss online safety and cyberbullying 06.jpg|thumb|Visiting Peterson Middle School in 2010]]
In 2011, Harris urged criminal penalties for parents of truant children as she did as District Attorney of San Francisco, allowing the court to defer judgment if the parent agreed to a mediation period to get their child back in school. Critics charged that local prosecutors implementing her directives were overzealous in their enforcement and that Harris's policy adversely affected some families.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-truancy-arrests-2020-progressive-prosecutor_n_5c995789e4b0f7bfa1b57d2e|title=IThe Human Costs Of Kamala Harris' War On Truancy|first=Molly|last=Redden|date=March 29, 2019|website=HuffPost|accessdate=May 25, 2020}}</ref> In 2013, Harris issued a report titled "In School + On Track", which found that more than 250,000 elementary school students in the state were "chronically absent" and that the statewide truancy rate for elementary students in the 2012–2013 school year was nearly 30%, at a cost of nearly $1.4 billion to school districts, since funding is based on attendance rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/tr/truancy_2013.pdf|title=In School + On Track: Attorney General's 2013 Report on California's Elementary School Truancy and Absenteeism Crisis|website=California Attorney General|accessdate=May 25, 2020}}</ref>

====Law enforcement accountability====

In 2015, Harris conducted a 90-day review of [[implicit bias]] and lethal use of force. In April 2015, Harris introduced the first of its kind "''Principled Policing: Procedural Justice and Implicit Bias''" training, designed in conjunction with [[Stanford University]] psychologist and professor [[Jennifer Eberhardt]], to help law enforcement officers overcome barriers to neutral policing and rebuild the relationship of trust between law enforcement and the community. All Command-level staff received the training. The training was part of a package of reforms introduced within the California Department of Justice, which also included additional resources deployed to increase the recruitment and hiring of diverse special agents, an expanded role for the department to investigate officer-related shooting investigations, and community policing.<ref>{{cite news |title=California Attorney General Launches Top-Down Policing Reforms|url=https://www.kqed.org/news/10493776/california-attorney-general-launches-top-down-policing-reforms|work=[[KQED]] |date=April 17, 2015|accessdate=May 29, 2020}}</ref> In 2015, Harris's California Department of Justice was the first statewide agency in the country to require all of its police officers to wear [[body cameras]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/live-updates/general-election/fact-checking-the-first-democratic-debate/harris-on-requiring-police-to-wear-body-cameras/?arc404=true|title=Harris on requiring police to wear body cameras|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 27, 2019}}</ref> That same year, Harris announced a new state law requiring every law enforcement agency in California to collect, report, and publish expanded statistics on how many people are shot, seriously injured or killed by peace officers throughout the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kqed.org/news/10813726/state-to-improve-police-use-of-force-data-next-year-under-new-law-2|title=State to Improve Police Use-of-Force Data Next Year Under New Law|work=[[KQED]]|date=December 30, 2015}}</ref>

Later that year, Harris appealed a judge's order to take over the prosecution of a [[2011 Seal Beach shooting|high-profile mass murder case]] and to eject all 250 prosecutors from the Orange County district attorney's office over allegations of misconduct by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] D.A. [[Tony Rackauckas]]. Rackauckas was alleged to have illegally employed jailhouse informants and concealed evidence.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sidney |last=Powell |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/scott-dekraai-case_n_6911258|title=California AG Appeals Booting Of Orange County DA From Mass Murder Case Over Misconduct Allegations|date=October 17, 2016|website=HuffPost|accessdate=May 1, 2020}}</ref> Harris noted that it was unnecessary to ban all 250 prosecutors from working on the case, as only a few had been directly involved, later promising a narrower criminal investigation. The [[U.S. Department of Justice]] began an investigation into Rackauckas in December 2016, but he was not re-elected.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tony |last=Saavedra |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2019/02/25/new-orange-county-da-willing-to-undergo-federal-probation-to-end-snitch-investigation/|title=New Orange County DA willing to undergo federal probation to end 'snitch' investigation|date=February 25, 2019|website=TheOCRegister|accessdate=May 1, 2020}}</ref>

In 2016, Harris announced a patterns and practices investigation into purported civil rights violations and use of [[excessive force]] by the two largest law enforcement agencies in [[Kern County, California]], the [[Bakersfield Police Department]] and the [[Kern County Sheriff's Department]].<ref>{{cite news |first1=Oliver |last1=Laughland|first2=Jon|last2=Swaine|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/22/california-police-kern-county-investigation-kamala-harris|title=Two 'deadliest' police departments in US to be investigated in California|date=December 22, 2016|website=The Guardian|accessdate=May 29, 2020}}</ref> Labeled the "deadliest police departments in America" in a five-part ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' expose, a separate investigation commissioned by the [[ACLU]] and submitted to the California Department of Justice corroborated reports of police using [[excessive force]]. The ACLU found that officers had engaged in patterns of excessive force – including shooting and beating to death unarmed individuals – as well as a practice of filing retaliatory criminal charges against individuals subjected to excessive force. Further analysis also revealed the highest rate of police homicides in the country, as well as excessive use of force, resulting in 17 deaths of unarmed civilians from 2009 to 2013 in the form of dog attacks and tazings.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Oliver |last1=Laughland|first2=Jon|last2=Swaine|url=https://www.kqed.org/news/11631037/aclu-report-slams-central-valley-law-enforcement-agencies|title=ACLU says violence at Kern County police departments violated rights|date=November 9, 2017|website=The Guardian|accessdate=May 29, 2020}}</ref>

=== Criminal justice reform ===
====Launch of Division of Recidivism Reduction and Re-Entry====
In November 2013, Harris launched the [[California Department of Justice]]'s Division of Recidivism Reduction and Re-Entry in partnership with district attorney offices in [[San Diego]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Alameda County]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Rina|last=Palta|url=https://www.scpr.org/news/2013/11/20/40494/attorney-general-kamala-harris-announces-new-divis/|title=Calif. Attorney General Kamala Harris announces new division to stop ex-prisoners from committing new crimes|accessdate=May 22, 2020|date=November 20, 2013}}</ref> In March 2015, Harris announced the creation of a pilot program in coordination with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department called "Back on Track LA". Like Back on Track, first time, nonviolent offenders between 18 and 30 individuals participated in the pilot program for 24–30 months. Assigned a case manager, participants received education through a partnership with the [[Los Angeles Community College District]] and job training services.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sheriff, AG Harris Unveil Program to Curb Recidivism|url=https://scvnews.com/sheriff-ag-harris-unveil-program-to-curb-recidivism/|first=Alex |last=Veiga |agency=SCV News|date=March 11, 2015}}</ref>
====Sentencing and prison inmate retention====
After the 2011 United States Supreme Court in ''[[Brown v. Plata]]'' declared California's prisons so overcrowded that they inflicted [[cruel and unusual punishment]], Harris fought federal court supervision, explaining "I have a client, and I don't get to choose my client."<ref name=NYTmag>{{cite news | last = Bazelon | first = Emily | title = Kamala Harris, a 'Top Cop' in the era of Black Lives Matter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/magazine/kamala-harris-a-top-cop-in-the-era-of-black-lives-matter.html| work = The New York Times Magazine | date = May 25, 2016}}</ref> Harris's record on [[wrongful conviction]] cases as attorney general has engendered some criticism from academics and activists. Law professor Lara Bazelon contends Harris "weaponized technicalities to keep wrongfully convicted people behind bars rather than allow them new trials."<ref>{{cite web|first=Lara|last=Bazelon|url=https://theappeal.org/kamala-harris-criminal-justice-record-killed-her-presidential-run/|title=Kamala Harris's Criminal Justice Record Killed Her Presidential Run |work=The Appeal|date=December 4, 2019}}</ref> Harris declined to take any position on criminal sentencing-reform initiatives [[California Proposition 36, 2012|Proposition 36 (2012)]] and [[California Proposition 47 (2014)|Proposition 47 (2014)]], arguing it would be improper because her office prepares the ballot booklets. John Van de Kamp, a predecessor as attorney general, publicly disagreed with the rationale.<ref name="NYTmag" />

====Death penalty====
In 2014, Judge [[Cormac J. Carney]] vacated the death sentence of convicted rapist and murderer Ernest Dewayne Jones, declaring [[capital punishment in California]] unconstitutional on the basis of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]'s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment because "systemic delay and dysfunction" rendered the process arbitrary.<ref name="San Francisco Chronicle">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/Why-does-Kamala-Harris-defend-the-death-penalty-6481227.php|title=Why does Kamala Harris defend the death penalty?|first=Mugambi|last=Jouet|publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> Harris appealed, contending Carney failed to abide by the highly-circumscribed ''[[habeas corpus]]'' procedure set forth in the binding Supreme Court precedent of ''[[Teague v.

Legal challenges to Prop 8 were presented by opponents soon after its approval, and a pair of same-sex couples filed a lawsuit against the initiative in federal court in the case of [[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]] (later [[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]).

On February 7, 2012, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]], in a 2–1 decision, reached the same conclusion as the district court, but on narrower grounds.

====Law enforcement====
[[File:Attorney General Kamala D. Harris Tours the Fresno Regional DNA Laboratory.jpg|thumb|AG Harris touring the Fresno Regional DNA Laboratory]]
California's [[2004 California Proposition 69|Proposition 69]] mandated law enforcement to collect DNA samples from any adult arrested for a felony and from individuals arrested for certain crimes. In 2012, Harris announced that the California Department of Justice had improved its DNA testing capabilities such that samples stored at the state's crime labs could now be analyzed four times faster, within 30 days. Accordingly, Harris reported that her Rapid DNA Service Team within the Bureau of Forensic Services cleared California's entire DNA backlog for the first time in history, having developed a process that allowed higher volume analysis of 5,400 evidence samples – an increase of 11% from 2010 (4,800) and 24% from 2009 (4,100).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2012/01/california-dna-evidence-attorney-general.html|title=California attorney general says DNA backlog is gone|newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 25, 2012}}</ref> In April 2014, Harris's team was honored with the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]'s Award for Professional Innovation in Victim Services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/04/08/attorney-general-kamala-harris-honored-for-rape-kit-processing/|title=Attorney General Kamala Harris Honored For Rape Kit Processing|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[CBS Sacramento]]|date=April 8, 2014}}</ref> Harris's office would later be awarded a $1.6 million grant from the [[Manhattan District Attorney]]'s initiative to eliminate the backlogs of untested [[rape kits]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.turlockjournal.com/news/crime/grant-awarded-to-test-rape-kits/|title=Grant awarded to test rape kits

In 2014, Harris introduced OpenJustice, a criminal justice data initiative designed with professor [[Steven Raphael]] making available statewide data on arrest rates, deaths in law enforcement custody, arrest-related deaths, and law enforcement deaths. Subsequent improvements to the platform revealed data pertaining to clearance rates and racial disparities in the criminal justice system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/17/california-dojs-openjustice-platform-makes-local-law-enforcement-data-more-transparent/|title=California's DOJ OpenJustice Platform Makes Local Law Enforcement Data More Transparent|work=[[TechCrunch]]|date=February 17, 2016}}</ref>

In 2011, Harris obtained a guilty plea and a four-year prison sentence from a [[stalker]] who used [[Facebook]] and [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] techniques to illegally access the private photographs of women whose social media accounts he hijacked.

In 2016, Harris announced the arrest of [[Backpage]] CEO Carl Ferrer on felony charges of [[pimping]] a [[Minor (law)|minor]], pimping, and conspiracy to commit pimping.
