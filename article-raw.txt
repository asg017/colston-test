==Incident==
Witnesses allege that Blake had been attempting to break up a fight between two women. It is unknown what lead to the police interacting with Blake, but it is reported that they attempted to subdue him with a [[taser]] to no effect. Video spread on social media shows Blake surrounded by police with their weapons already drawn. Blake ignores their demands, walking around his vehicle and attempting to enter it. As he does, one police grabs him and begins firing his weapon into Blake's back. Blake's children were reportedly inside the vehicle at the time.<ref name="dm">{{cite web |url=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8657225/Police-shooting-Wisconsin-leaves-1-person-hospitalized.html |title=White cop shoots unarmed black father in the back seven times in front of his children after being called to domestic dispute - igniting massive protests as Wisconson governor slams the 'excessive use of force' |date=August 24, 2020}}</ref>
