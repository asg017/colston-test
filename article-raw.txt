'''Edward Colston''' ([[2 November]] [[1636]] &ndash; [[11 October]] [[1721]]) was a [[Bristol]]-born [[England|English]] slave trader. Much of his wealth, although used often for generous purposes, was acquired through the trade and exploitation of [[slavery|slaves]].

== Life and career ==

He was born [[2 november]] [[1636]] in Church Street, Bristol, the youngest of at least fifteen children. His parents were [[William Colston]], a prosperous merchant and Sarah (''née'' Batten). He was brought up in Bristol until the time of the [[English Civil War]], when he probably lived for a while on his father's estate in [[Winterbourne, South Gloucestershire|Winterbourne]], south [[Gloucestershire]]. The family then moved to [[London]] where Edward may have been a pupil at [[Christ's Hospital]].

He was apprenticed to the [[Mercers Company]] for eight years and by 1672 was shipping goods from [[London]]. He built up a lucrative business, trading with [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]] and [[Africa]]. In 1680, Colston became a member of the [[Royal African Company]], which had held the monopoly in [[Kingdom of England|Britain]] on [[gold]], [[ivory]] and slave trading since 1662.  

His parents had resettled in Bristol and in 1682 he made a loan to the Corporation, the following year becoming a member of the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] and a [[burgess (title)|burgess]] of the City. In 1684 he inherited his brother's mercantile business in Small Street, and was a partner in a sugar refinery in St. Peter's Churchyard; shipping sugar from [[St. Kitts]]. But he was never resident in Bristol, carrying on his London business from [[Mortlake]] in [[Surrey]] until he retired in 1708.

He founded [[almshouse]]s in King Street and on [[St. Michaels Hill]], endowed [[Queen Elizabeth's Hospital]] school and helped found [[Colston's School]], which opened in 1710 leaving an endowment to be managed by the Society of Merchant Venturers for its upkeep. He gave money to schools in Temple and other parts of Bristol, and to several churches and the cathedral. He was a strong [[Tory]] and high-churchman, and was returned as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol]] in 1710 for just one parliament. David Hughson writing in 1808 described Colston:
''[Cromwell House was certainly the residence, in the last century, of] that excellent man Edward Colston, Esq. the great benefactor of the city of Bristol, who, in his lifetime, expended more than 10,000L. [£] in charitable institutions.''

He died [[11 October]] [[1721]] at his home, (old) Cromwell House (demolished 1857), in Mortlake. His body was carried back to Bristol and was buried at [[All Saints, Bristol|All Saints Church]]. His tomb was designed by [[James Gibbs]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Church of All Saints  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379381 | accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref>

==Colston and Bristol today==

''A statue, designed by [[John Cassidy (artist)|John Cassidy]], was erected in the centre of Bristol in 1895 commemorating Colston.<ref>{{cite web | title=Edward Colston | work=PMSA National Recording Project | url=http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/BL/BR09.htm | accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref> He was widely viewed as an inspirational figure for the city, due to his donations of money to schools and other causes. His name permeates the city in such landmarks as [[Colston Tower]], [[Colston Hall]], [[Colston Hill]], Colston Street, Colston Parade, [[Colston's Girls' School]] and [[Colston's School]]. He is also remembered, particularly in schools, by Colston's Day, on [[13 November]].
