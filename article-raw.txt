He was shot as he tried to enter his SUV, where his children were in the backseat. 

The shooting was followed by protests, rioting, property damage, fires in downtown Kenosha, and further clashes with riot police. Blake's name was invoked in protests in other cities as part of the larger [[Black Lives Matter]] movement, which had seen a resurgence in the wake of high-profile police killings in 2020, including those of [[Killing of George Floyd|George Floyd]], [[Killing of Rayshard Brooks|Rayshard Brooks]], and [[Shooting of Breonna Taylor|Breonna Taylor]].<ref name=PeiserWP />
