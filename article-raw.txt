'''Edward Colston''' (2 November 1636 – 11 October 1721) was an English merchant, philanthropist and [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] Member of Parliament. He was an important local benefactor in his native city of [[Bristol]], donating money to charitable causes aligned with his political and religious views.<ref name=CorkSecondPlaque />{{Fv|this is what some groups proposed for plaque text, not a RS}} Since the late twentieth century he has been a controversial figure in Bristol's history because of his involvement in the [[Atlantic slave trade]].

Colston became a merchant, initially trading in wine, fruits and cloth, mainly in Spain, Portugal and other European ports. In 1680, he became involved in the slave trade through his work on the committees of the [[Royal African Company]], which held a monopoly on the English trade in African slaves. He was Deputy Governor of the company in 1689–90. It is uncertain how much of his wealth was acquired through slave trading.<ref name=EC_morgan /><ref name=hayton/>{{Fv|reason=source says he made the bulk of his money from the slave trade|date=June 2020}}<ref name="dresser">{{cite journal |last=Dresser |first=Madge |year=2000 |title=Squares of distinction, webs of interest: Gentility, urban development and the slave trade in Bristol c.1673–1820 |journal=Slavery & Abolition a Journal of Slave and Post-Slave Studies |publisher=Routledge |volume=21 |issue=3 |page=22 |issn=1743-9523 |doi=10.1080/01440390008575319 |url=http://ejscontent.ebsco.com/ContentServer.aspx?target=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.informaworld.com%2Fsmpp%2Fftinterface%3Fcontent%3Da794052444%26format%3Dpdf%26magic%3Debscohostejs |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710170556/http://ejscontent.ebsco.com/ContentServer.aspx?target=http:%2F%2Fwww.informaworld.com%2Fsmpp%2Fftinterface%3Fcontent=a794052444&format=pdf&magic=ebscohostejs |archivedate=10 July 2011|quote=Some subsequent scholars have preferred to stress [...] his other commercial involvements -- in fruit and wines and cloth, and in West Indian sugar.

Colston used his wealth to support and endow schools, hospitals, almshouses and churches in Bristol, London and elsewhere. His name is commemorated in several Bristol landmarks, streets, schools and the "[[Colston bun]]". Charitable foundations inspired by ones he founded survive.<ref name=":0">{{cite news |url=https://www.dolphin-society.org.uk/history |title=Edward Colston, the Dolphin Society and 268 years of letter-writing...History / Background |date=16 May 2015 |work=The Dolphin Society |access-date=19 October 2018}}</ref>

==Early life==
Colston was born on 2 November 1636 in Temple Street,<ref name=ODNB_morgan/> [[Bristol]], and baptised in the [[Temple Church, Bristol]]. His parents were William Colston (1608–1681), a prosperous Royalist merchant who was [[High Sheriff of Bristol]] in 1643, and his wife Sarah Batten (d.1701), daughter of Edward Batten; he was the eldest of at least 11 and possibly as many as 15 children. The Colston family had lived in the city since the late 13th century.<ref name=hayton>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/colston-edward-ii-1636-1721 |title=Colston, Edward II |website=The History of Parliament |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |last1=Hayton |first1=David |last2=Cruickshanks |first2=Eveline |last3=Handley |first3=Stuart |date=April 2006 |accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref> Colston was brought up in Bristol until the time of the [[English Civil War]], when he probably lived for a while on his father's estate in [[Winterbourne, South Gloucestershire|Winterbourne]], just north of the city. The family then moved to London where Edward may have been a pupil at [[Christ's Hospital]] school.<ref name=ODNB_morgan>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5996 |title=Colston, Edward |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |last=Morgan |first=Kenneth |date=September 2004 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/5996 |accessdate=14 August 2010}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref>

==Career==
In 1654 Colston was apprenticed to the [[Mercers Company]] for eight years, and in 1673 he was enrolled into it.<ref name=ODNB_morgan /> By 1672 he had become a merchant in London.<ref name=hayton/> Like his father Colston exported in textiles from London while importing oils, wine and sherry from Spain and Portugal. It was also noted he traded silk to Virgina.<ref name=EC_morgan /> He had built up a successful business trading with Spain, Portugal, Italy and Africa.<ref name=ODNB_morgan /> 

In 1680, Colston became a member of the [[Royal African Company]], which had held the monopoly in [[Kingdom of England|England]] on trading along the [[West Africa|west coast of Africa]] in gold, silver, [[ivory]] and [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]] from 1662.<ref name=ODNB_morgan /> Colston was deputy governor of the company from 1689 to 1690. His association with the company ended in 1692.<ref name=hayton/> This company had been set up by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and his brother the [[James II of England|Duke of York (later King James II)]], who was the governor of the company, together with [[City of London]] merchants, and it had many notable investors, including philosopher and physician [[John Locke]] (who later changed his stance on the slave trade) and the diarist [[Samuel Pepys]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bl.uk/restoration-18th-century-literature/articles/britains-involvement-with-new-world-slavery-and-the-transatlantic-slave-trade |title=Britain's involvement with New World slavery and the transatlantic slave trade |website=The British Library |access-date=18 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The sugar barons: family, corruption, empire, and war in the West Indies |last=Matthew |first=Parker |date=2011 |publisher=Walker & Co |isbn=9780802717443 |location=New York |pages=126 |oclc=682894539}}</ref>

During Colston's involvement with the Royal African Company from 1680 to 1692 it is estimated that the company transported over 84,000 African men, women and children to the [[Caribbean]] and the rest of the Americas, of whom 19,000 died on their journey.<ref name=CorkSecondPlaqueRow>{{cite web

Enslaved Africans were much less expensive to maintain than [[indentured servants]] or paid [[wage labour]]ers from Britain.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/archaeology/caribbean/ |title=Slavery in the Caribbean – International Slavery Museum, Liverpool museums |website=liverpoolmuseums.org.uk |access-date=19 November 2018}}</ref>

Colston's parents had resettled in Bristol. In 1682 he made a loan to the [[Bristol Corporation]], the following year becoming a member of the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] and a [[burgess (title)|burgess]] of the City. In 1684 he inherited his brother's mercantile business in Small Street, and was a partner in a [[sugar refinery]] in St Peter's Churchyard, shipping [[raw sugar]], produced by slaves, from [[St Kitts]]. However, Colston was only resident as an adult in Bristol for a while, and by 1689 he was carrying on his London business from [[Mortlake]] in Surrey. 

Although a [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] [[High church|High Churchman]] and often in conflict with the Whig corporation of Bristol, Colston transferred a large segment of his original shareholding to [[William III of England|William III]] at the beginning of 1689, securing the new regime's favour for the African Co. The value of Colston's shares increased and being without heirs he began to donate large sums to charities. He withdrew from the African Co. in 1692, but continued trading in slaves privately. He retired in 1708. Colston was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] for [[Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol]] (1710-13).<ref>{{cite book |last=Gardiner |first=Juliet |author-link=Juliet Gardiner |date=2000 |title=The History Today Who's Who In British History |location=London |publisher=Collins & Brown Limited and Cima Books |page=192 |isbn=1-85585-876-2}}</ref>

Colston died on 11 October 1721 at his home, (old) Cromwell House (demolished 1857), in Mortlake, aged 84. His will stated that he wished to be buried simply without pomp, but this instruction was ignored.<ref> Edward Colston Will, National archives Wills Online</ref> His body was carried to Bristol and was buried at [[All Saints' Church, Bristol|All Saints' Church]].

In Bristol, he founded [[almshouse]]s in King Street and [[Colstons Almshouses]] on St Michael's Hill, endowed [[Queen Elizabeth's Hospital]] school, and helped found [[Colston's School|Colston's Hospital]], a boarding school which opened in 1710 leaving an endowment to be managed by the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] for its upkeep. He gave money to schools in Temple (one of which went on to become [[St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School]]) and other parts of Bristol, and to several churches and the cathedral.

[[David Hughson]], writing in 1808, described Colston as "the great benefactor of the city of Bristol, who, in his lifetime, expended more than 70,000L. [£] in charitable institutions".<ref name="hughson">{{cite book |last=Hughson |first=David |title=London; Being An Accurate History And Description of the British Metropolis And Its Neighbourhood, To Thirty Miles Extent, From An Actual Perambulation |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g8wAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA386 |volume=V |year=1808 |publisher=J Stratford |location=Holborn Hill, London |page=386 |chapter=Circuit of London}}</ref>

He is also remembered, particularly by some schools, charities and the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]], on Colston Day (13 November), which celebrates the granting of a royal charter to the Society of Merchant Venturers in 1639, at a church service now held at [[St Stephen's Church, Bristol|St Stephen's Church]].{{cn|date=June 2020}} 

===Modern reappraisal===
Since at least the 1990s, with increasing recognition of Colston's role in the slave trade, there has been growing criticism of the commemoration of Colston in Bristol.<ref>[https://www.ft.com/content/032fe4a0-9a96-11e8-ab77-f854c65a4465  Judith Evans, "Bristol, the slave trade and a reckoning with the past", ''[[Financial Times]]'', 9 August 2018]. Retrieved 9 June 2020</ref>

According to Morgan in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', it is thought that Colston made much of his fortune from the buying and selling of slaves.<ref name=ODNB_morgan /> According to Morgan in ''Edward Colston and Bristol'', the proportion of his wealth that came from his involvement in the slave trade and slave-produced sugar is unknown, and can only be the subject of conjecture unless further evidence is unearthed. As well as this income, he made money from his trade in the other commodities mentioned above, interest from [[money lending]], and, most likely, from other careful financial dealings.<ref name=EC_morgan>{{cite book |title=Edward Colston and Bristol |last=Morgan |first=Kenneth |publisher=Bristol Branch of the Historical Association |year=1999 |isbn= |location=Bristol |pages=3 |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/bristolrecordsociety/publications/bha096.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200608093149/http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/bristolrecordsociety/publications/bha096.pdf |archive-date=8 June 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>
