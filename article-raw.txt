After the announcement by Democrat [[Barbara Boxer]] that she would retire from the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] at the end of her term in 2017 after serving as California's junior senator for four terms, Kamala Harris was the first candidate to declare she would vie for the seat.

==Issues==
===Gun control===
Harris has been a vocal proponent for gun control her entire career. While serving as District Attorney in Alameda County Harris recruited other District Attorneys and filed an amicus brief in ''[[District of Columbia v.

===Housing===
When Harris took office, California was still reeling from the effects of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. Harris participated in the National Mortgage Settlement against five banks: [[Ally Bank|Ally]], [[Wells Fargo]], [[Bank of America]], [[Citi Bank]], and [[Chase (bank)|Chase]]. She originally walked off the talks because she believed the deal was too lenient. She later rejoined the talks, securing $12 billion of debt reduction for the state's homeowners and $26 billion overall.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/03/04/EDLH1NFBG5.DTL|title=Kamala Harris' foreclosure deal a win for state|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|author= Parker, Barbara and Rebecca Kaplan|date=March 5, 2012|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> Other parts of the funding would go to state housing counseling services and legal help for struggling homeowners and forgiving the debt of over 23,000 homeowners who agreed to sell their homes for less than the mortgage loan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/12/business/la-fi-0512-harris-housing-20120512|title=Mortgage deal cash is divvied|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Lazo, Alejandro|date=May 12, 2012|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref>

Later, she introduced the California Homeowner's Bill of Rights in the [[California State Legislature]], a package of several bills that would give homeowners more "options when fighting to keep their home". It would ban the practices of "dual-tracking" and [[Robo-signing|robosigning]] and provide homeowners with a single point of contact at their lending institution.

===Death penalty===
Harris is opposed to the death penalty but has said that she would review each case individually.<ref name="sfbg.com">{{cite news |title=Give Kamala Harris credit for integrity |author=Tim Redmond |url=http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2009/09/11/give-kamala-harris-credit-integrity |newspaper=[[The San Francisco Bay Guardian]] |date=November 9, 2009 |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref> Her position was tested in April 2004, when [[San Francisco Police Department|SFPD]] Officer Isaac Espinoza was murdered in the Bayview district. Harris announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing. The decision evoked protests from the San Francisco Police Officers Association, Sen. [[Dianne Feinstein]], and others.  Those who supported the decision not to seek the death penalty included San Francisco Supervisors [[Tom Ammiano]] and [[Sophie Maxwell]], in whose district the murder occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basetree.com/photos/sets/photography39.html |title=Don't Kill in Our Name, Rally to Support Kamala Harris |publisher=Basetree |date=May 5, 2004 |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> The jury found the convicted killer, David Hill, guilty of second-degree murder although the prosecutor, Harry Dorfman, had sought a first-degree murder conviction.<ref name="SF Sentinel">{{cite web|url=http://www.sanfranciscosentinel.com/?p=1353 |title=Police Officer Isaac Espinoza killer gets two consecutive life sentences—No possibility of parole |publisher=Sanfranciscosentinel.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> The defense had argued that Hill thought Espinoza was a member of a rival gang and that the murder was not premeditated. Hill was given the maximum sentence for the conviction, life without the possibility of parole.<ref name="SF Sentinel" />

Harris's position against the death penalty was tested again in the case of [[Edwin Ramos]], an [[illegal immigrant]] and alleged [[MS-13]] gang member who was accused of murdering Tony Bologna and his sons Michael and Matthew.<ref name="latimes.com">Finnegan, Michael. [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-harris22-2009jun22,0,3668981,full.story "San Francisco D.A.'s program trained illegal immigrants for jobs they couldn't legally hold"], ''Los Angeles Times'', June 22, 2009.</ref> On September 10, 2009, Harris announced she would seek life in prison without the possibility of parole rather than the death penalty in the Ramos case.<ref name="The San Francisco Chronicle">Van Derbeken, Jaxon. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/11/BAM819L7NE.DTL "Edwin Ramos won't face death penalty"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', September 11, 2009.</ref>

Harris has expressed the belief that life without possibility of parole is a better, and more cost-effective, punishment.<ref name="CA Capitol">{{cite web|url=http://californiascapitol.com/blog/?p=341 |title=San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris |publisher=Californiascapitol.com |date=April 15, 2009 |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> According to the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, the death penalty conservatively costs $137 million per year.<ref name="CCAFJ report">{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfaj.org/documents/CCFAJFinalReport.pdf |title=CCFAJ-Report-final.pdf |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> If the system were changed to life without possibility of parole, the annual costs would be approximately $12 million per year.<ref name="CCAFJ report" /> Harris noted that the resulting surplus could put 1,000 more police officers into service in San Francisco alone.<ref name="CA Capitol" />

===Violent crimes, felons, incarceration and conviction rate===
While Harris was San Francisco District Attorney, the overall felony conviction rose from 52% in 2003 to 67% in 2006, the highest in a decade; there was an 85% conviction rate for homicides, and convictions of drug dealers increased from 56% in 2003 to 74% in 2006.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/34 "Convicting Felons"]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> While these statistics represent only trial convictions, she has also closed many cases via plea bargains.{{cn|date=September 2014}} When she took office, she took a special interest in clearing some of the murder caseload from the previous administration. Harris claimed that the records were less than optimal from the previous administration and worked to get convictions on what she could. That meant that out of the 73 homicide cases backlogged, 32 cases took deals for lesser charges such as manslaughter or took pleas to other crimes such as assault or burglary while the murder charges were dismissed.<ref>Van Derbeken, Jaxon. [http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-03-20/news/17287759_1_conviction-handling-of-criminal-cases-homicide/4 "Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', March 20, 2006, p. 4.</ref>

However, critics argue that San Francisco sends fewer people to jail per arrest than other counties throughout the state. The San Francisco DA's incarceration rates are among the lowest in the entire state of California—fully ten times lower than in San Diego County, for example. According to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', "roughly 4 of every 100 arrests result in prison terms in San Francisco, compared with 12.8 out of 100 in Alameda County, 14.4 of 100 in Sacramento County, 21 of 100 in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, 26.6 of 100 in Fresno County, 38.7 of 100 in Los Angeles County and 41 of 100 in San Diego County."<ref name="Police1">{{cite web|author=ITT Night Vision |url=http://www.policeone.com/community-policing/articles/1203289-San-Francisco-chief-calls-justice-system-too-lenient/ |title=San Francisco chief calls justice system too lenient |publisher=Policeone.com |date=January 14, 2007 |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> Police also note that lenient sentencing from San Francisco judges also plays a role in this.<ref name="Police1" />

While officers within the SFPD have credited Harris with tightening loopholes in bail and drug programs that defendants have exploited in the past, they have also accused her of being too deliberate in her prosecution of murder suspects.<ref>Van Derbeken, Jaxon. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/03/20/MNG01HQVPA1.DTL#ixzz0jKyN3hF9 "Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', March 20, 2006.</ref> Additionally, in 2009 San Francisco prosecutors won a lower percentage of their felony jury trials than their counterparts at district attorneys' offices covering the ten largest cities in California, according to data on case outcomes compiled by officials at the San Francisco Superior Court as well as by other county courts and prosecutors. (Officials in Sacramento, the sixth-largest city in California, did not provide data.) Harris's at-trial felony conviction rate that year was 76%, down 12 points from the previous year. By contrast, the most recent recorded statewide average was 83%, according to statistics from the California Judicial Council.<ref name="Lack of Conviction">Jamison, Peter. [http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-05-05/news/a-lack-of-conviction/ "A Lack of Conviction"], ''SF Weekly'', May 5, 2010.</ref> In a small sample, a report computed that the conviction rate for felony trials in San Francisco County in the first three months of 2010 was just 53%.<ref name="Lack of Conviction" /> San Francisco has historically had one of the lowest conviction rates in the state; the county is known for a defendant friendly jury pool.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=LJX3Ql7bu2YC&pg=PA960&lpg=PA960&dq=%22San+Francisco%22+%22low+conviction+rates%22#v=onepage&q=%22San%20Francisco%22%20%22low%20conviction%20rates%22&f=false |title=Encyclopedia of crime and punishment, Volume 1 By David Levinson |publisher=Books.google.com |date= March 18, 2002|accessdate=November 18, 2010|isbn=978-0-7619-2258-2}}</ref><ref name="sfweekly.com">{{cite web|author=Peter Jamison |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-05-05/news/a-lack-of-conviction/ |title=A Lack of Conviction - Page 1 - News - San Francisco |publisher=SF Weekly |date=May 5, 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}</ref>

===Hate crimes and civil rights===
Harris created a special Hate Crimes Unit as San Francisco District Attorney. She focused on hate crimes against [[LGBT]] children and teens in schools. She convened a national conference to confront the "gay-transgender panic defense", which has been used to justify violent hate crimes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kamalaharris.org/issues/113 |title=Hate Crimes and Protecting Victims |publisher=Kamalaharris.org |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> Harris supports same-sex marriage in California and opposed both [[Proposition 22]] and [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kamalaharris.org/MarriageEquality |title=Marriage Equality |publisher=Kamalaharris.org |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref>

In 2004, The [[National Urban League]] honored Harris as a "Woman of Power", and she received the [[Thurgood Marshall#Thurgood Marshall Award|Thurgood Marshall Award]] from the National Black Prosecutors Association in 2005. In her campaign for California Attorney General, she received the endorsements of numerous groups, including the abortion rights [[EMILY's List]], California Legislative Black Caucus, Asian American Action Fund, Black Women Organized for Political Action, Mexican American Bar Association, South Asians for Opportunity, and the National Women's Political Caucus.<ref name="Endorsements">{{cite web|url=http://kamalaharris.org/endorsements |title=Endorsements |publisher=Kamalaharris.org |date=September 24, 2010 |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref>

Harris has been vocal in the immigration debate, supporting San Francisco's immigration policy of not inquiring about immigration status in the process of a criminal investigation.<ref>Jesse McKinley (11/16/06) [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/us/12sanctuary.html Immigrant Protection Rules Draw Fire] The New York Times.

===Education===
In interviews with [[Matt Lauer]] on ''[[The Today Show]]'' and local [[KGO-TV]], Harris argued for treating "habitual and chronic truancy" among children in elementary school as a crime committed by the parents of truant children. She argues that there is a direct connection between habitual truancy in elementary school and crime later in life.<ref>{{cite web|author=&ldquo;&rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i0tpAqrDDY |title=KGO/ABC 7's View from the Bay's Interview with Kamala Harris on Truancy Rates |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=&ldquo;&rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-c-4FlgUT0 |title=Kamala Harris on the Today Show |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> She has received the endorsement of the California Federation of Teachers.<ref name="Endorsements" />

===Environment===
During her time as San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created the Environmental Justice Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Jason B.|title=SAN FRANCISCO / D.A. creates environmental unit / 3-staff team takes on crime mostly affecting the poor|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-06-01/bay-area/17376837_1_environmental-justice-bird-droppings-san-francisco-city-hall|accessdate=August 20, 2010|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 1, 2005}}</ref> and has prosecuted several industries and individuals for pollution, most notably [[U-Haul]], Alameda Publishing Corporation, and the [[Cosco Busan oil spill]]. She has also advocated for strong enforcement of environmental protection laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kamalaharris.org/issues/Environment|accessdate=October 3, 2011|title=Protecting the Environment}}</ref>

===Financial crimes===
Harris has prosecuted numerous financial crimes throughout her career, particularly those affecting elders, those involving use of high-technology, and identity theft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kamalaharris.org/issues/594 |title=Prosecuting Financial Crimes |publisher=Kamalaharris.org |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> She has indicated that as attorney general she would crack down on [[predatory lending]] and other financial crimes.<ref>{{cite news|title=S.F. attorney Kamala Harris enters attorney general race|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zfQlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=U_0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=3372,1028608&dq=kamala-harris+financial+crime&hl=en|accessdate=August 20, 2010|newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel|date=November 13, 2008}}</ref>

===Police department laboratory and disclosure failures===
San Francisco Police Department drug lab technician Deborah Madden admitted to taking amounts of [[cocaine]] from evidence samples in the police department's crime lab. The testing unit of the police department lab was shut down on March 9, 2010. Since then, hundreds of drug cases have either been dismissed or discharged due to evidentiary requirements. While Harris's office was aware of troubling issues at the police department's drug lab months before the issue became public, the entire scope of the issues did not become clear until Madden was exposed for removing drug samples.<ref>{{cite web|author=8:21 PDT |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/SFPD-drug-lab-technician-issues-not-addressed-90907184.html#ixzz0nkuMJLsz |title=Drug lab technician issues not addressed &#124; San Francisco Examiner |publisher=Sfexaminer.com |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}</ref> The police department later widened the investigation into their crime lab to include cases that were already prosecuted.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-04-03/news/20833423_1_drug-lab-crime-lab-drug-cases |title=Kamala Harris faces tough questions in race - SFGate |publisher=Articles.sfgate.com |date=April 3, 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2010 | first=Marisa | last=Lagos}}</ref>

On May 4, 2010, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported that a number of felony convictions were in jeopardy when it was revealed that the prosecuting attorneys did not disclose criminal backgrounds for relevant San Francisco police officers before testifying.<ref name="articles.sfgate.com">{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-05-04/news/20883129_1_police-officers-cocaine-cases-police-disciplinary-cases |title=S.F. cops' pasts could jeopardize convictions - SFGate |publisher=Articles.sfgate.com |date=May 4, 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2010 | first=Jaxon | last=Van Derbeken}}</ref> On May 20, 2010, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo ruled that prosecutors had violated defendants' rights by failing to disclose damaging information about the police drug lab technician. The judge concluded that prosecutors had failed to fulfill their constitutional duty to tell defense attorneys about problems surrounding Deborah Madden, the now-retired technician at the heart of the cocaine-skimming scandal that led police to shut down the drug analysis section of their crime lab. Harris's office has been unable to vouch for the reliability of Madden's work and has dismissed more than 600 drug cases since the scandal became public in February. Madden testified at trials before leaving the lab in December. Under a 1963 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling, ''[[Brady v. Maryland]]'', district attorneys are obligated to provide defense attorneys with information in their possession about prosecution witnesses that could be used to challenge their credibility.
 
Massullo wrote that top drug prosecutor Assistant District Attorney Sharon Woo's November 19 memo about Madden to Russ Giuntini, Chief Assistant District Attorney, and Jeffrey Ross, head of the criminal division, showed that prosecutors "at the highest levels of the district attorney's office knew that Madden was not a dependable witness at trial and that there were serious concerns regarding the crime lab".<ref>{{cite web|author=8:21 PDT |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/SFPD-drug-lab-technician-issues-not-addressed-90907184.html#ixzz0pl0VitGe |title=Drug lab technician issues not addressed &#124; San Francisco Examiner |publisher=Sfexaminer.com |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}</ref> The failure by Harris's office "to produce information actually in its possession regarding Madden and the crime lab is a violation of the defendants' constitutional rights", Massullo wrote. The Judge said that the prosecutors had the "duty to implement some type of procedure to secure and produce information relevant to Madden's criminal history". But Massullo said her repeated requests that prosecutors explain why they did not have such procedures were met with "a level of indifference". However, Judge Massullo refused to dismiss any cases, saying that all cases must be considered individually.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/05/21/BAN01DHVMU.DTL#ixzz0od05q8Qb |title=Judge rips Harris' office for hiding problems |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=May 21, 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2010 | first=Jaxon | last=Van Derbeken}}</ref>

On May 26, 2010, the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' reported that a San Francisco coroner's supervising toxicologist, Ann Marie Gordon, vouched for blood-test results in drunken-driving cases for two years before prosecutors told defense attorneys that a Washington state court had labeled her as a "perpetrator of fraud" while running that state's toxicology lab. San Francisco prosecutors began telling defense attorneys about Gordon's past after the ''Chronicle'' reported earlier in May 2010 that scores of police officers had criminal arrests or misconduct cases that were never called to defendants' attention before trials. Prosecutors are obligated to provide potentially exculpatory information about their witnesses to the defense under the 1963 US Supreme Court ruling.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/05/26/MNJP1DJPEN.DTL#ixzz0pAuhDNOD |title=Problems of S.F. toxicologist not disclosed |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2010 | first=Jaxon | last=Van Derbeken}}</ref>

===Daniel Larsen case===
On August 24, 2012, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published an editorial calling on Harris to release Daniel Larsen from prison.<ref name=LATimes>{{cite news|author=|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/24/opinion/la-ed-larsen-20120824 |title=Daniel Larsen should be freed from prison, whatever it takes | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 24, 2012 |accessdate=January 11, 2014}}</ref> Larsen, who was sentenced to 28 years to life under California's [[three strikes laws]] for possession of a concealed weapon in 1999, was declared "[[actually innocent]]" by a federal judge in 2009 and ordered released. Evidence in favor of Larsen included that of a former chief of police and the actual owner of the knife; Larsen's original lawyer, who failed to call a single witness, has since been disbarred.<ref name="NYDN"/> Larsen remained in prison because Harris's office objected to his release on the grounds that he missed the deadline to file his [[writ of habeas corpus]]. The [[California Innocence Project]], which had taken up Larsen's case, said this amounts to a paperwork technicality. The ''Times'' editorial stated that if Harris was not willing to release Larsen, Governor Jerry Brown should pardon him. In March 2013, Larsen was released on bond with the case on appeal by order of Attorney General Harris "on technical grounds".<ref name="NYDN">{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/daniel-larsen-innocent-california-prisoner-freed-13-years-behind-bars-article-1.1293456 | title=Daniel Larsen, ‘innocent’ California prisoner, freed after 13 years behind bars | work=[[NY Daily News]] | date=March 19, 2013 | accessdate=January 14, 2015 | author=Knowles, David}}</ref> In September 2013, the [[Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals]] upheld the ruling and on January 27, 2014, the [[Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office]] dismissed the charge.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=4350 | title=Daniel Larsen | publisher=[[National Registry of Exonerations]] | date=January 27, 2014 | accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref>

==Personal life==
While she was an Alameda County Deputy District Attorney in the 1990s, she dated [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]], the powerful Speaker of the [[California State Assembly]].
