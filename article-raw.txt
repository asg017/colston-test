This authority was usually only granted to judges and could have had a big impact in San Francisco where drug violations accounted for nearly 70% of prosecuted crimes.<ref name=Kayo/>

Harris opposed the measure, as did Hallinan, who was the only District Attorney in the state to oppose the measure.<ref name=Kayo/> However, Harris, concerned about the possibility of nearly 40,000 kids per year{{snd}}mostly [[Minority group#Involuntary minorities|minority]]{{snd}}being tried in adult court, became very involved in campaigning against the measure, including attending rallies as a speaker, writing position papers and volunteering for the "No-On-21" campaign on weekends.<ref name=Kayo/> Her knowledge and commitment to the issue was such that the District Attorney's Public Information Officer at the time, Fred Gardner, would give reporters the option to interview both Harris and Hallinan. However, doing so reportedly made Hallinan suspicious that Harris was trying to usurp him in preparation of challenging him for the next election (in 2003).<ref name=Kayo/> Salomon approached Gardner and allegedly accused him of helping Harris: "You're trying to make a star out of Kamala Harris."<ref name=Kayo/> Gardner dismissed the accusation, noting that "she [Harris] is already a star," and was then reportedly told by Salomon to stop directing Prop 21 media inquiries to Harris as he believed Harris had "an agenda" given she was "Willie Brown's protege."<ref name=Kayo/>

Gardner confronted Harris and inquired if she was planning to run in 2003. She reportedly replied that it would be "unprofessional" to run against Hallinan if he decided to run for a third term.<ref name=Kayo/> Gardner relayed Harris' response to Hallinan.  However, Gardner stated that Hallinan "did not believe her."<ref name=Kayo/>  Hallinan then ordered that all calls from reporters, not only those pertaining to Prop 21, go directly to him: "I'm the elected official.  I'm the D.A. It's my office. Except for my spokesman, I don't want anybody going to the media."<ref name=Kayo/>

Hallinan then reassigned Harris, which Harris believed to be a ''[[de facto]]'' demotion, and set a [[canary trap]] to test her loyalty by divulging supposedly confidential information to her and watching to see if was leaked to the media.<ref name=Kayo/>  It was, but the leaker turned out to be Hallinan himself, not Harris.<ref name=Kayo/>

Shortly after her reassignment, Harris was a part of a group of supervisors who confronted Hallinan about Salomon, seeking to "overthrow" him.<ref name=Karma/> However, when their attempt failed, Harris then filed a complaint against Salomon and quit.<ref name=Quits/><ref name=Karma/>

The spokesman for the District Attorney's office called Harris' defection "a sad day [because Harris was] a good lawyer, well-liked and brilliant."<ref name=Quits/>

Salomon resigned two weeks after Harris left.<ref name=TopAide/>  He reportedly blamed Harris for "stirring up resentment towards him."<ref name=Kayo/>

===City Attorney===
In August 2000, Harris took a new job at [[San Francisco City Hall]], working for elected [[City Attorney]], [[Louise Renne]].<ref name=Quits/> Renne hired Harris to take the place of Katherine Feinstein, after Feinstein was appointed as a [[Alameda County Superior Court|Superior Court Judge]].<ref name=Quits/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womensradio.com/articles/This-DA-Makes-a-Difference-for-Women/559.html |title=Women's Radio: This DA Makes a Difference For Women |publisher=Womensradio.com |accessdate=November 18, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219095441/http://www.womensradio.com/articles/This-DA-Makes-a-Difference-for-Women/559.html |archivedate=December 19, 2010}}</ref><ref name=Quits/>  Harris ran the Family and Children's Services Division representing child abuse and [[Child neglect|neglect]] cases, domestic violence, building code enforcement, and public health matters.<ref name=Karma/><ref name=Quits/>  Renne said of Harris:

{{quote|"She will make the best DA this city has seen in years."<ref name=Karma/>}}

===2003 Campaign for District Attorney===
====Campaign organization====
[[File:Congresswoman Pelosi meets San Francisco's District Attorney, Kamala Harris; March 30, 2004.jpg|thumb|Harris with Congresswoman [[Nancy Pelosi]], 2004]]
Harris was reportedly so angry about the discontent in Terence Hallinan's office that she decided to run against him.<ref name=Karma/>  She began "methodically gathering support" by attending political events, volunteering on other campaigns, assuming [[Board of directors|board memberships]] on nonprofits, being seen at exclusive parties, and presenting herself as an alternative to a "political has-been."<ref name=Karma/>

In mid-2002, Harris called Mark Buell, the stepfather of her friend, [[Walker family|Summer Tompkins Walker]], and told him of her intention to run for District Attorney against the two-term incumbent{{snd}}and her former boss.<ref name=Launched/>  Buell was married to major Democratic megadonor, [[Susie Tompkins Buell]].  He was doubtful of Harris' candidacy as he had only thought of her as "a socialite with a law degree"  However, Buell, impressed by Harris, offered to be her [[Political campaign staff|finance chair]].<ref name=Launched/>

Buell advised that to beat an incumbent, Harris would need to raise more than $150,000, the highest amount ever raised to campaign for the position.  He and Harris organized a finance committee composed mostly of Harris' friends, who were "young socialite ladies".<ref name=Launched/>  The committee included [[Getty family|Vanessa Getty]] and [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art#Elected Trustees|Susan Swig]].  While Harris, saying that the black community was "her base",<ref name=Karma/> set up her campaign office in [[Bayview–Hunters Point, San Francisco|Bayview]]{{snd}}the "most isolated neighborhood" in San Francisco<ref name=Launched/>{{snd}}the committee arranged for her to "routinely" raise money in the exclusive neighborhood of [[Pacific Heights, San Francisco|Pacific Heights]], with 25% of her donations coming from Pacific Heights alone:

Harris was also seeking to run a campaign that disrupted negative [[Stereotypes of African Americans|stereotypes of black women]]:<ref name=Karma/>

{{quote|“...Black female candidates have to fight the perception that black women are not competent. When whites look at black women they see [them] as servants, maids or cooks...Being able to cross over into the white community is essential for any black, female or male, to succeed as a political figure.

When Harris announced her candidacy, she had served on the board of trustees of the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco]], had been a member of [[SFJAZZ Center|San Francisco Jazz Organization]], was a patron dinner chair for the [[San Francisco Symphony|San Francisco Symphony's]] Black & White Ball, was the executive director of the San Francisco Domestic Violence Consortium, led the board of directors of Partners Ending Domestic Abuse, and was a board member of nonprofit, Women Count. Harris was also documented attending exclusive events, dressing in luxury clothing such as [[Burberry]], and dining with the heirs of billionaires:<ref name=Launched/>

{{quote|"...people wanted to be able to say they’d met her and were supporting her because of this quasi-social network that we started with, and the more she raised, and the more she got traction, the more everybody else wanted to say they heard her, they talked to her and were supportive...but they were kind of professional [[socialite]]s, and they wanted to help her. They saw it as a two-way street."<ref name=Launched/> –– Sharon Owsley, ''Socialite and Attorney''}}

In 2003, Harris entered the election, running against two-term incumbent and former boss, Terence Hallinan, and defense attorney, Bill Fazio.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Nina|title=Why Kamala Matters|url=http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/why-kamala-matters|accessdate=May 12, 2015|work=San Francisco Magazine|date=August 2007 |archive-date=2015-02-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215203550/http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/why-kamala-matters }}</ref><ref name=Continue>{{cite news|first=Alison |last=Soltau|title=Panel rules DA candidate can continue spending|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=October 16, 2003}}</ref> Harris was the least known candidate among the three, but noted to be "whip-smart, hard-working, and well-credentialed."<ref name=Continue/><ref name=Karma/>

Hallinan and Fazio sought to [[Cronyism|link Harris to Willie Brown]], who was openly campaigning and fundraising for Harris, through a [[Political action committee|PAC]]{{snd}}California Voter Project{{snd}}though reportedly without her consent.<ref name=Karma>{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Byrne |title=Kamala's Karma |newspaper=San Francisco Weekly |accessdate=April 22, 2020 |date=September 24, 2003|url=https://www.sfweekly.com/news/kamalas-karma/ }}</ref> Harris denied financially benefitting from Brown. However, Mark Buell later admitted that he met with Brown for lunch and Brown volunteered a campaign tactic to him.<ref name=Karma/> Buell also admitted that Brown personally donated $500{{snd}}the individual donation maximum{{snd}}to Harris after [[Walker family|Summer Tompkins Walker]] reportedly asked Brown to donate while at a restaurant.<ref name=Karma/>

{{quote|"How can Harris root out corruption if she has Willie supporting her behind the scenes?  I do not care that they had a relationship, but there are legitimate questions whether or not there is payback there."<ref name=Karma/> –– Bill Fazio}}

However, Harris supporters said that statements used to tie her to Willie Brown were [[Misogyny|misogynistic]]. Harris' sister, Maya, asked: “When a woman dates an accomplished man, why are people so willing to assume it's only because of him that the woman is successful?" <ref name=Karma/>  Harris' mother stated:

{{quote|"What has Willie Brown done for her?  Introduce her to society people when they dated?  If they did not like Kamala on her own right, they would have dropped her after she dropped Willie.  Kamala is comfortable in all kinds of social scenes.  She can pull it off in [[High society (social class)|high society]], too. She has the manners, the eating habits."<ref name=Karma/>}}

Harris' campaign later successfully lobbied the 24-member [[California Democratic Party#County central committees|Central Committee]]{{snd}}including U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein and then-House Majority leader [[Nancy Pelosi]]{{snd}}of the statewide Democratic party to deny their influential endorsement to either of Harris' competitors.<ref name=Karma/>  It was the first time the Central Committee had withheld its endorsement from an incumbent.

====Campaign spending violation====
[[File:Kamala Harris (5122897990).jpg|thumb|right|Rally at [[University of Southern California|USC]], 2010]]
Harris was found to be guilty, by the city's Ethics Commission, of violating campaign spending limit of $211,000, of which Harris had agreed to abide by before the campaign commenced.<ref name=Continue/>  Harris had overspent the pledged amount by nearly $100,000.  The Commission's own staff was later accused of abusing its discretion, and favoring Harris, when it retroactively lifted the campaign spending limit after Harris' campaign had spent over the limit, and when Harris' campaign said that it was recognizing the Commission as the authority of the limit's forms rather than the Department of Elections.<ref name=Continue/>  The Commission denied the accusations, saying that its staff acted with its authority under local law.<ref name=Continue/>

Harris' supporters said her campaign mistakenly violated the spending cap due to a "misinterpretation of confusing law changes" on the forms.<ref name=Continue/> They also argued that the cap put lesser-known candidates at a disadvantage, which was unfair since Harris had to spend more to increase her profile.  However, critics charged that the forms were straightforward for any attorney to understand.  Critics were also adamant that Harris willfully violated the spending cap and argued that, even if Harris mistakenly overspent the cap, that doing so was indefensible under the law.<ref name=Continue/>

Harris ran a "Notice to Voters" in newspapers stating that she never agreed to limit her campaign spending, but said her failure to file the form (to decline the campaign spending cap) on time on was "due to errors by her campaign."<ref name=Notice>{{cite news|author=Kamala Harris|title=Notice to Voters|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=October 20, 2003}}</ref>  Harris' campaign lawyer also argued that the spending cap violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].  Harris' campaign was questioned on why she would agree to the spending limit if it was, in fact, unconstitutional.  Harris' campaign responded that political candidates face political pressure "to accept rules that hinder their constitutional rights."<ref name=Continue/>

Harris was fined nearly $35,000 by the Commission and ordered to alert voters, in her mailers, that she had violated the spending limit.  The mailers, subsequently produced by her campaign, were said to have displayed her spending violation with "the smallest font in America."<ref name=Continue/>

Harris, who the [[San Francisco Examiner]] called "a relative unknown", went on to spend nearly $625,000 throughout the campaign while Hallinan spent just over $285,000.<ref name=Ousts>{{cite news|author=Alison Soltau and Ethan Fletcher|title=Harris ousts veteran Hallinan|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=December 10, 2003}}</ref>  It was more than four times more than any candidate had raised in the history of running for the office.<ref name=Launched/>

====Runoff election====
[[File:MS5 1047 0.jpg|thumb|[[Baldwin Hills, Los Angeles|Baldwin Hills]], 2014]]
Harris garnered negative press from the campaign spending violation, but was said to have run a "forceful" campaign, assisted with the political and personal backing of former boyfriend, mayor [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]], and connections to the city's [[High society (social class)|high society]].<ref name=Ousts/><ref name=Launched/> Harris secured "an impressive array" of endorsements, including from Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]], Sheriff [[Michael Hennessey]], writer and cartoonist [[Aaron McGruder]] (who Harris noted was a close friend), and comedians [[Eddie Griffin]] and [[Chris Rock]].<ref name=Ousts/><ref name=Sunset>{{cite news|author=Adriel Hampton|title=Harris stumps in the Sunset|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=July 28, 2003}}</ref><ref name=Celebs>{{cite news|author=J.K.

Bill Fazio had been eliminated from the election after initial voting. Hallinan and Harris, who garnered 37% and 33% of the vote, respectively, would have a [[Two-round system|runoff]].<ref name=Runoff>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200422151156/https://napavalleyregister.com/news/two-to-duel-in-sf-mayor-runoff-vallejo-s-intinoli/article_74c086c0-13e6-50d6-800f-60793f1521ee.html |url-status=live |url=https://napavalleyregister.com/news/two-to-duel-in-sf-mayor-runoff-vallejo-s-intinoli/article_74c086c0-13e6-50d6-800f-60793f1521ee.html |title=Two to Duel in SF Mayor Runoff; Vallejo Intinoli's Win|publisher=The Napa Valley Register|date=November 5, 2003|archive-date=2020-04-22 }}</ref>

In the runoff, Harris sought to differentiate her policy positions from those of Hallinan, as it was a "problem" that they ideologically agreed on key issues such as being against the use of the [[capital punishment|death penalty]].<ref name=Karma/>  Harris ran on making the [[sexual abuse]] of children her top issue.<ref name=Struggle>{{cite news|author=Adriel Hampton|title=Kamala Harris' struggle for self-definition |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/templates/story.cfm?displaystory=1&storyname=102803n_harris |publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=October 28, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031226151009/http://www.sfexaminer.com/templates/story.cfm?displaystory=1&storyname=102803n_harris |archive-date=2003-12-26 }}</ref>  She charged that, though she worked for Hallinan for two years, she left his office because it was "dysfunctional," technologically inept and was "a mess."  She attacked Hallinan for promoting people in his office without [[Meritocracy|merit]], for his "abysmal" conviction rate for [[felony|serious crimes]] (at just under 65%){{snd}}over 10 percent lower than [[Arlo Smith|his predecessor's]] rate{{snd}}lowering office morale, and for his willingness to accept [[Plea bargaining in the United States|plea bargains]] in cases of [[domestic violence]]:<ref name=Ousts/><ref name=Struggle/><ref name=Karma/>

{{quote|"It is not progressive to be soft on crime."<ref name=Karma/> –– Kamala Harris, 2003}}

Hallinan refuted that Harris was misrepresenting his office.  For example, he stated the decrease in [[conviction rate]] was not due to the performance of his office, but because of a [[diversion program]] that he created for criminals.<ref name=Karma/>

Harris was lauded for her campaigning skills, particularly for "listen[ing] carefully to the concerns of ordinary people."<ref name=Karma/>  She was rumored to have worked 16 hours per day on her campaign, but was charged by critics as being a "machine" candidate more concerned with conviction rates than the people who were actually convicted:<ref name=Struggle/><ref name=Karma/>

{{quote|"It's not the tradition in San Francisco to favor punishment over [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]]. We are not concerned with the conviction rate, we don't want to come down hard on people accused of crimes, we don't want to nail them to the cross."<ref name=Karma/> –– Jeff Adachi, ''Public Defender'', 2003}}

Harris also accrued negative publicity. Being [[upper middle class]] she was portrayed as being out of touch with her self-described "black base."<ref name=Karma/> She reportedly told a group of affluent blacks at [[Yerba Buena Gardens]], along with affluent whites in Pacific Heights, "The most victimized people do not vote, so you have to act on their behalf."<ref name=Karma/> Also, while talking to three black men, outside of a [[Visitacion Valley, San Francisco|Sunnydale]] [[Subsidized housing in the United States|housing project]], who planned to protest [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|the Muni transit system]] for not honoring its promise to hire young blacks to work on a new [[Light rail in the United States|light-rail system]], Harris suggested they "ask a police captain to conduct a protest training [so] you can protest safely." The organizer of the protest, Harold Kyer, was reportedly embarrassed to have to explain to Harris that her suggestion was naive:

{{quote|"Our community is not police-friendly, Ms. Harris. They will not come to a meeting if the police show up."<ref name=Karma/>}}

Harris faced additional criticism. Her support of Proposition M, which would increase criminal penalties for [[Begging|panhandling]] without providing funds for housing or health services for the homeless, conflicted with her [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] platform. However, the stance aligned her with Mayoral candidate, [[Gavin Newsom]], whose campaign was supporting the initiative. Harris was also criticized, near the end of the campaign, for holding a press conference in which she vocalized a case about a woman who was tortured by her boyfriend with a hot iron, in order to attack Hallinan's record on [[domestic violence]].<ref name=Respect>{{cite news|author=Adriel Hampton|title=Domestic violence victim says DA Hallinan showed respect|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=December 8, 2003}}</ref>  Harris did not talk to, or consult with, the victim prior to citing the case.  However, Hallinan did speak with the victim and her family.  The victim subsequently praised Hallinan for "respect[ing] her desire not to have the case become a media spectacle."  Harris was accused of politicizing the victim.<ref name=Respect/>

Harris won with 56.33% of the vote and became the first woman to lead the District Attorney's Office of San Francisco.<ref name=Ousts/>

In April 2004, [[San Francisco Police Department]] Officer Isaac Espinoza was shot and killed in the line of duty. Three days later, Harris announced she would not seek the [[death penalty]], angering the [[San Francisco Police Officers Association]]. During Espinoza's funeral at [[Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption (San Francisco, California)|St. Mary's Cathedral]], U.S. Senator and former San Francisco mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] rose to the pulpit and called on Harris, who was sitting in the front pew, to secure the death penalty, prompting a standing ovation from the 2,000 uniformed police officers in attendance. Harris still refused. Espinoza's killer was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.<ref name=NYTmag/>

In 2004, as district attorney, Harris started the Back On Track initiative, a reentry program.<ref name=NYTmag/> Initiative participants (who are nonviolent, first-time drug offenders whose crimes were not weapon- or gang-related) plead guilty in exchange for a deferral of sentencing and regular appearances before a judge over a year-long period.

When Harris took office, she cleared part of the murder caseload from the previous administration. She stated that the records from that administration were less than ideal, and worked to get convictions on what she could. Out of the 73 homicide cases backlogged, over 40% of them took deals for lesser charges, such as [[manslaughter]], pleaded to other crimes, such as [[assault]] or [[burglary]] while the murder charges were dismissed.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jaxon|last=Van Derbeken|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-03-20/news/17287759_1_conviction-handling-of-criminal-cases-homicide/4|title=Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=March 20, 2006|page=4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118160154/http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-03-20/news/17287759_1_conviction-handling-of-criminal-cases-homicide/4 |archive-date=January 18, 2012 }}</ref>

In 2004, Harris pushed for higher bail for criminal [[defendant]]s involved in gun-related crimes. She argued that low [[bail]] encouraged outsiders to commit crimes in San Francisco.

Officers within the [[San Francisco Police Department]] credited Harris with tightening [[loophole]]s in bail and drug programs that defendants had used in the past. However, they also accused her of being too deliberate in her prosecution of murder suspects.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jaxon|last=Van Derbeken|url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Trials-and-tribulations-of-Kamala-Harris-D-A-2521498.php |title=Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=March 20, 2006|accessdate=March 9, 2019}}</ref>

In 2009, Harris' prosecutors won a lower percentage of their [[felony]] jury trials than their counterparts at district attorneys' offices covering the 10 largest cities in California. Her at-trial felony conviction rate that year was 76 percent, down 12 percent from the previous year, was more than 5 percent under the statewide average.<ref name="Lack of Conviction">{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Jamison|url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/a-lack-of-conviction/Content?oid=2177022 |title=A Lack of Conviction|newspaper=[[SF Weekly]]|publisher=San Francisco Media Company|location=San Francisco, California|date=May 5, 2010|accessdate=March 9, 2019}}</ref>

In 2012, Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo ruled that Harris's office violated defendants' rights by hiding damaging information about a San Francisco Police Department crime lab technician, that Harris' office had ignored a constitutional obligation to turn over to defense attorneys the criminal histories of police testifying at trial, and that Harris' office was indifferent to demands that it account for its failings.<ref name="SFVanDerbeken">{{cite news|first=Jaxon|last=Van Derbeken|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Judge-rips-Harris-office-for-hiding-problems-3263797.php |title=Judge rips Harris' office for hiding problems|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=July 28, 2010}}</ref><ref name=Secrecy>{{cite news|first=Matt |last=Smith |title=A Secrecy Fetish|url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/a-secrecy-fetish/Content?oid=2177326 |accessdate=April 22, 2020 |publisher=San Francisco Weekly |date=June 2, 2010}}</ref>

==== Child Abuse in Catholic Church ====
[[File:Kamala Harris.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Dept. of Justice, 2013]]
In the 1970s, Joey Piscitelli was repeatedly [[rape]]d by the principal of his [[Catholic schools in the United States|Catholic High School]], Father Stephen Whelan.<ref name=Cooperating>{{cite news|first=Lee |last=Fang|title=As San Francisco District Attorney, Kamala Harris's Office Stopped Cooperating with Victims of Catholic Church Child Abuse |url=https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/kamala-harris-san-francisco-catholic-church-child-abuse/ |accessdate=April 22, 2020 |work=[[The Intercept]] |date=June 9, 2019}}</ref> In 2004, he was pursuing a [[civil court|civil case]] against the church that oversaw his high school and seeking help to strengthen his case.

Piscitelli had previously gone to the District Attorney's office when Terrance Hallinan was the D.A. and received the assistance he requested. Hallinan's office provided Piscitelli with access to files it had obtained in 2002 after Hallinan directed investigators to try to build a case against the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|archdiocese]] and forced the archdiocese to turn over 75 years of its own records.<ref name=Cooperating/> The files implicated high-level church officials and detailed how they internally handled [[pedophile]] priests.<ref name=Coddles>{{cite news|first=Try |last=Bundy |title=Kamala Harris Takes A Stand on Internet Pedophiles, Coddles Pedophile Catholic Priests|publisher=San Francisco Weekly |url=https://www.sfweekly.com/news/kamala-harris-takes-a-stand-on-internet-pedophiles-coddles-pedophile-catholic-priests/ |date=June 3, 2010}}</ref><ref name=Secrecy/>  The files had been successfully used to indict a priest, Father Austin Peter Keegan.<ref name=Cooperating/>

Piscitelli intended to use the files in a similar manner, seeking any information that could be helpful in his civil suit against the church that oversaw his high school. At the time, a civil trial was the only avenue for [[restitution]] available to victims following a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision [[Stogner v. California|overturning a California law]] that retroactively eliminated the [[statute of limitations]] for criminal prosecution of child molestation cases.<ref name=Cooperating/>  Many sexual abusers who were facing criminal charges prior to the ruling were set free, including Keegan.<ref name=Cooperating/><ref name=Keegan>{{cite news|first=Richard |last=Somerville |author2=The Associated Press|title=Accused priest to walk free|url=https://www.theunion.com/news/local-news/accused-priest-to-walk-free/ |accessdate=April 22, 2020 |publisher=The Union|date=27 June 2003}}</ref> However, in 2003, California passed a state law that allowed victims to file civil lawsuits against their alleged abusers if they could prove that the employers of the abusers knew of the misconduct and did nothing to stop it.<ref name=Cooperating/> Piscitelli's civil suit was already underway when he contacted Harris, shortly after she defeated Hallinan.
 
Piscitelli says Harris's office did not respond to his letters or calls, and would not allow him to access the files. In response, Piscitelli and his family and friends began mounting posters across the city to force Harris to respond. He sought help from the media, which requested access to the files under [[California Public Records Act|California's Public Records Act]], but Harris's deputy, Paul Henderson, denied the request, stating that Harris's investigative files "were not subject to California's government transparency laws."<ref name=Secrecy/> In 2005, when [[San Francisco Weekly]] writer Ron Russell attempted the request again, a Harris spokesperson told him:

{{quote|"If we did it [granted access to files] for you, we would have to do it for everybody. Where do you stop, and where do you start?"<ref name=Secrecy/>}}

Repeated attempts by reporters to access the files were similarly denied over the years, with Harris's spokesperson, Erica Derryck, not responding to calls or emails from reporters. Eventually, in 2010, Harris's office released a statement:

{{quote|"District Attorney Harris focuses her efforts on putting child molesters in prison. We're not interested in selling out our victims to look good in the paper. When this case was brought under Terence Hallinan, prosecutors took the utmost care to protect the identity and dignity of the victims. That was the right thing to do then and it's the right thing to do now."<ref name=Secrecy/>}}

Critics charged that the statement was "dangerous," as not exposing predators could endanger more children.<ref name=Secrecy/> They argued that releasing such records was not only "routine," but also cruel, in that it further burdened victims with having to resort to costly litigation if they wanted to obtain records that documented the crimes that happened against them.<ref name=Secrecy/> Critics also charged that the statement implied that the district attorney's office was incapable of simply redacting victims' names from the released material.<ref name=Secrecy/><ref name=Cooperating/>

Supporters of Harris maintain she did the right thing in not releasing the documents:

{{quote|"I don’t think a district attorney should float that out there if a person can’t defend themselves. It’s a very serious charge, a sex crime."<ref name=Cooperating/>  –– Elliot Beckelman, Former San Francisco Assistant District Attorney}}

In 2006, Piscitelli won his civil case, doing so without the help of Harris's office.<ref name=Survivors>{{cite news|author=Try Bundy|title=Survivors of Priest Abuse Make Proposal to Church|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/us/24bcclergy.html |accessdate=April 22, 2020 |date=23 April 2011}}</ref>

=== Hate crimes and civil rights ===
[[File:Kamala Harris Img64.jpg|thumb|Pride Parade, 2013]]
As San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created a special Hate Crimes Unit, focusing on [[hate crime]]s against [[LGBT]] children and teens in schools. She supports [[same-sex marriage]] in California and opposed both [[Proposition 22]] and [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kamalaharris.org/MarriageEquality|title=Marriage Equality|publisher=Kamalaharris.org|accessdate=November 18, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125112342/http://kamalaharris.org/MarriageEquality|archivedate=November 25, 2010}}</ref>

In 2004, The [[National Urban League]] honored Harris as a "Woman of Power". In 2005, she received the [[Thurgood Marshall#Thurgood Marshall Award|Thurgood Marshall Award]] from the National Black Prosecutors Association. In her campaign for California Attorney General, she received the endorsements of many groups including [[EMILY's List]], [[California Legislative Black Caucus]], [[Asian American Action Fund]], [[Black Women Organized for Political Action]], the [[National Women's Political Caucus]], Mexican American Bar Association, and South Asians for Opportunity.<ref name="Endorsements">{{cite web|url=http://kamalaharris.org/endorsements|title=Endorsements|date=September 24, 2010|publisher=Kamalaharris.org|accessdate=November 18, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125060802/http://kamalaharris.org/endorsements|archive-date=November 25, 2010|url-status=dead}}{{better source|date=July 2019}}</ref>

====Opposition to the "gay panic" and "trans panic" defenses====
{{main|Murder of Gwen Araujo}}
In early 2006, [[Gwen Araujo]], a 17-year old American Latina transgender teenager was murdered by two men who later used the "[[gay panic defense]]" before being convicted of second-degree murder. Harris, alongside Araujo's mother Sylvia Guerrero, convened a two-day conference of at least 200 prosecutors and law enforcement officials nationwide to discuss strategies to counter such legal defenses saying, "the suggestion that criminal conduct is mitigated by bias or prejudice is inappropriate. We can't outlaw it, but we can combat it."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/462922087/ |title=Harris challenges 'gay panic' strategy|page=4 |date=July 5, 2006 |newspaper=The San Francisco Examiner }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/468380490/ |title='Gay Panic:' Not an excuse |newspaper=Casper Star-Tribune |date=July 20, 2006 }}</ref>

Harris subsequently supported A.B. 1160, the Gwen Araujo Justice for Victims Act, advocating that California's penal code include jury instructions to ignore bias, sympathy, prejudice or public opinion in making their decision, also making mandatory for district attorney's offices in California to educate prosecutors about panic strategies and how to prevent bias from affecting trial outcomes.<ref name="AB 1160"/> In September 2006, California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] signed A.B. 1160 into law; the law put California on record as declaring it contrary to public policy for defendants to be acquitted or convicted of a [[lesser included offense]] on the basis of appeals to "societal bias".<ref name="AB 1160">{{cite web

===Civil rights ===
==== County prosecutors' misconduct ====
In 2015, Harris defended convictions obtained by county prosecutors who had inserted a false confession into an interrogation transcript, committed perjury, and withheld evidence.<ref name="NYTmag" /> Federal appeals court Judge [[Alex Kozinski]] threw out the convictions, telling lawyers, "Talk to the attorney general and make sure she understands the gravity of the situation."<ref name="NYTmag" />

In March 2015, a [[California superior courts]] judge ordered Harris to take over a criminal case after [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] District Attorney [[Tony Rackauckas]] was revealed to have illegally employed jailhouse informants and concealed evidence.<ref name="NYTmag" /> She refused, appealing the order and defending Rackauckas.<ref name="NYTmag" />

Harris appealed the dismissal of an indictment when it was discovered a [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] prosecutor perjured in submitting a falsified confession as court evidence. In the case, she argued that only abject physical brutality would warrant a finding of prosecutorial misconduct and the dismissal of an indictment, and that perjury alone was not enough.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sidney |last=Powell |url=https://observer.com/2015/03/california-prosecutor-falsifies-transcript-of-confession/ |title=California Prosecutor Falsifies Transcript of Confession|date=March 4, 2015|website=The Observer|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2781830/people-v-velasco-palacios-ca5/|title=People v.

==== Prison conditions and sentencing reform ====
After the United States Supreme Court in ''[[Brown v.

Harris refused to take any position on criminal sentencing-reform initiatives [[California Proposition 36, 2012|Proposition 36 (2012)]] and [[California Proposition 47 (2014)|Proposition 47 (2014)]], arguing it would be improper because her office prepares the ballot booklets.<ref name="NYTmag" /> Former California Attorney General [[John Van de Kamp]] considered her explanation "baloney."<ref name="NYTmag" />

==== Mitrice Richardson case ====
{{main|Death of Mitrice Richardson}}
Mitrice Richardson was a 24-year-old African American woman who was released from the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department in the middle of the night without any means of fending for herself. Her body was later found in an isolated canyon, leaving the family with many unanswered questions. In 2016, the Attorney General opened a criminal investigation into the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]]'s handling of the Mitrice Richardson case. The AG's Office had originally declined the request of the Richardson family to investigate the case, but reversed course after the family and supporters submitted almost 500 pages of evidence to Harris's office in the hope of prompting an investigation.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news |date=February 12, 2016 |url=https://www.dailynews.com/2016/02/12/california-attorney-general-opens-criminal-investigation-into-sheriffs-department-over-mitrice-richardson-case/ |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |first=Susan |last=Abram |title=California attorney general opens criminal investigation into Sheriff's Department over Mitrice Richardson case|access-date=December 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.laweekly.com/she-went-missing-from-a-sheriffs-station-now-the-state-wants-answers/ |title=She Went Missing From a Sheriff's Station.

==== Workers rights====
In 2012, Harris announced a $1 million settlement with the owner of eight car washes across California. The car washes, which did not have required licenses from the California Labor Commissioner to operate, routinely failed to pay minimum wage or overtime, created false records of work hours, and failed to pay money owed to employees that quit. <ref name="auto1">{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Thissen|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2012/01/10/san-ramon-carwash-to-pay-settlement-in-unpaid-wages-case/|title=San Ramon carwash to pay settlement in unpaid wages case|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|publisher=[[Digital First Media]]|location=San Mateo, CA|date=January 10, 2012}}</ref>At least $800,000 of the settlement went to the workers who were underpaid, with the remainder going toward taxes and penalties. <ref name="auto1"/>

In 2015, Harris signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the [[U.S. Department of Labor]]’s Wage and Hour Division to crack down on employer wage theft, facilitating the sharing of information between offices to enhance enforcement of labor violations. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-partners-us-department-labor-combat-wage-theft|title=Attorney General Kamala D.

====Housing====
In 2012, Harris participated in the National Mortgage Settlement against five banks, securing $12 billion of debt reduction for the state's homeowners and $26 billion overall.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Kamala-Harris-foreclosure-deal-a-win-for-state-3381270.php |title=Kamala Harris' foreclosure deal a win for state |date=March 5, 2012 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |last=Parker |first=Barbara |first2=Rebecca |last2=Kaplan |accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2012-may-12-la-fi-0512-harris-housing-20120512-story.html |title=Mortgage deal cash is divvied | date=May 12, 2012 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Lazo |first=Alejandro |accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref>

She introduced the California Homeowner's Bill of Rights in the [[California State Legislature]], a set of laws which took effect on January 1, 2013, banning the practices of "dual-tracking" (processing a modification and foreclosure at the same time) and [[robo-signing]], and provided homeowners with a single point of contact at their lending institution. It also gave the California Attorney General more power to investigate and prosecute financial fraud and to convene special [[grand jury|grand juries]] to prosecute multi-county crimes instead of prosecuting a single crime county by county.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-passage-bills-california-homeowner |title=Attorney General Kamala D.

====For-profit colleges====
In 2013, Harris filed suit against for-profit post-secondary education company [[Corinthian Colleges]] for false advertising and deceptive marketing targeting vulnerable, low-income students and misrepresenting job placement rates to students, investors, and accreditation agencies. <ref>{{cite web | url=

====Rent-to-own retailers====
In 2014, Harris forced rent-to-own retailer [[Aaron's, Inc.]] to refund $28.4 million to California customers and pay $3.4 million in civil penalties to settle allegations that it violated California’s Karnette Rental-Purchase Act by charging improper late fees, overcharging customers who paid off contracts early, and omitting important contract disclosures. <ref>{{cite web |first=Maria|last=Armental|url=

On February 12, 2015, Harris announced that she would start a new agency called the Bureau of Children's Justice. The bureau would work on issues such as [[foster care]], the juvenile justice system, school [[truancy]], and childhood trauma. She appointed special assistant attorney general Jill Habig to head the agency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/news/kamala-harris-bureau-of-childrens-justice-taking-shape/9513|title=Kamala Harris' Bureau of Children's Justice Takes Shape|last=Heimpel|first=Daniel|date=February 28, 2015|website=The Chronicle of Social Change|location=San Francisco|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref>

==== Human trafficking ====
In October 2016, Harris announced the arrest of [[Backpage]] CEO Carl Ferrer on felony charges of [[pimping]] a [[Minor (law)|minor]], pimping, and conspiracy to commit pimping. The arrest warrant alleged that 99% of Backpage's revenue was directly attributable to prostitution-related ads, many of which involved victims of sex trafficking, including children under the age of 18.<ref>{{Cite press release|url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-criminal-charges-against-senior|title=Attorney General Kamala D.

The pimping charge against Ferrer was dismissed by the California courts in 2016 on the grounds of [[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act]], but in 2018 Ferrer ultimately pleaded guilty in California to [[money laundering]] and agreed to give evidence against the former co-owners of Backpage, Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin.<ref name="Jackman">{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Jackman |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2018/04/13/backpage-ceo-carl-ferrer-pleads-guilty-in-three-states-agrees-to-testify-against-other-website-officials/ |title=Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer pleads guilty in three states, agrees to testify against other website officials |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=April 13, 2018 |accessdate=April 22, 2020 }}</ref> Ferrer simultaneously pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering and conspiracy to facilitate prostitution in Texas state court and Arizona federal court.<ref name="Jackman"/><ref name="Thompson">{{Cite news|first=Don|last=Thompson|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/ap-backpagecom-ceo-pleads-guilty-to-california-money-charges-2018-4 |title=Backpage.com CEO pleads guilty to California money charges|agency=Associated Press|date=April 12, 2018|access-date=April 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Montgomery Advertiser]]|page=3B|title=Backpage CEO pleads guilty, could spend 5 years in prison|first1=Megan|last1=Cassidy|first2=Ricgard|last2=Ruelas|date=April 14, 2018}}</ref>

In 2013, Harris declined to file a civil enforcement action against future [[U.S. Treasury Secretary]] [[Steve Mnuchin]]'s bank [[OneWest]] despite evidence "suggestive of widespread misconduct." While investigators in Harris' office recommended filing a civil enforcement action against the bank, they also noted that such an action would result in OneWest, a federally chartered bank, to assert that the state claims would be pre-empted by federal regulations imposed by the [[Dodd-Frank Act]] and trigger prolonged and costly litigation at taxpayer expense.<ref name="auto2">{{cite news |title=Kamala Harris has complicated history with Wall Street |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/26/kamala-harris-has-complicated-history-with-wall-street.html |first=Carmin |last=Chappell |work=CNBC |date=January 26, 2019}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3250383-OneWest-Package-Memo.html|title=Executive Summary - Request for Authorization to File Action against OneWest Bank, FSB OneWest Investigation (SF20122105513)|date=January 18, 2013|work=California Department of Justice}}</ref> With the law against them and protracted litigation anticipated, Harris exercised [[prosecutorial discretion]] and declined to use taxpayer dollars to pursue further action, later voting against Mnuchin's 2017 confirmation to become [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]]. <ref>{{cite news|author=Carmin Chappell|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/26/kamala-harris-has-complicated-history-with-wall-street.html|title=Kamala Harris' Complicated History with Wall Street will come under scrutiny in the 2020 race|publisher=CNBC|date=January 26, 2019}}</ref>In 2017, she said that her office's decision not to prosecute Mnuchin was based on "following the facts and the evidence...like any other case." <ref>{{cite web|first=Sylvan|last=Lane|url=https://thehill.com/policy/finance/312742-senate-democrat-defends-decision-not-to-charge-trump-treasury-pick-over |title=Dem defends decision not to charge Trump Treasury pick over foreclosures|newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=January 4, 2017}}</ref>Harris' press secretary later noted correctly that the state attorney general's office was additionally hampered by an inability to issue subpoenas due to [[OneWest Bank]]'s status as a federally chartered bank.  <ref name="auto2"/>Binding [[Supreme Court]] precedent have consistently held that  "[...] state laws that conflict with federal law are 'without effect'" ''Maryland v.

In her first term as Attorney General, Harris prioritized enforcement against transnational criminal organizations.  In 2011, Harris announced the conclusion of "Operation Red Reach," a coordinated law enforcement sweep that shut down a network of local and transnational gangs in [[Contra Costa County]], including affiliates of [[Nuestra Familia]] and the [[Norteños]], resulting in 35 arrests, and the seizure of more than 135 pounds of methamphetamine, 26 firearms, and nearly $87,000 in cash. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-takedown-contra-costa-gangs-nets-35|title=Attorney General Kamala D.

[[File:Kamala Harris meeting with advocates from Planned Parenthood Action Fund C53hx uU8AIwn t (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Planned Parenthood|Planned Parenthood Action Fund]], 2017]]
In 2013, when she was California Attorney General, Harris allowed the Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian to cease the availability of elective abortions, after it entered a partnership with Catholic chain, St. Joseph Health System.<ref name=Hoag>{{cite news|author=Seema Mehta |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2013-jun-21-la-fi-hiltzik-20130623-story.html |title=Devious Ban on Abortion at Hoag|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 23, 2013}}</ref> The ban was made due to St. Joseph's "sensitivity" about abortion.  As the Attorney General, Harris had legal authority to decide on any such change, as a condition of her approving a major transaction involving any non-profit medical institution in the state.<ref name=Hoag/>  The ban would not be able to go into affect without her knowledge or approval.<ref name=Hoag/>  Harris did set conditions on the ban, requiring the hospital to "take steps to ensure that alternative providers are available and accessible to all women, especially low-income women for direct abortions" in the hospital's serviceable area.<ref name=Hoag/>

Critics voiced concern that by imposing Catholic doctrine on its operations, St. Joseph was reducing the availability of reproductive services while receiving millions of dollars from taxpayers through Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements and a legal status that allowed it to be tax-exempt while taking tax deductions.<ref name=Hoag/>

In July 2015, an organization called "The Center for Medical Progress" ([[Trade name|dba]] "Biomax"), a registered California non-profit corporation posted five videos, shot in Texas, as evidence of proof that [[Planned Parenthood]] was "illegally trafficking aborted fetal parts."<ref name=Firestorm>{{cite news|author=Christine Mai-Duc|title=An antiabortion firestorm|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 8, 2015}}</ref> The videos were found to be manipulated{{snd}}[[propaganda]] produced by [[Anti-abortion movement|anti-abortion activists]] who used fake California identification to establish a [[Shell corporation|ghost]] California non-profit corporation.<ref name=Stand>{{cite news|author=Robin Abcarian|title=Where Does Kamala Harris Stand?|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 25, 2016}}</ref> Within two months of the videos' posting, a Texas grand jury indicted the two activists responsible for producing them.

While a spokesperson for Harris said that "the office does not comment on investigations, or even confirm whether an investigation exists," abortion rights advocates began to speculate that Harris' senatorial campaign to replace [[Barbara Boxer]] might have contributed to Harris' "lack of urgency" on the case.<ref name=Stand/>

However, in September 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed "Assembly Bill 1671" into law, which was reportedly drafted by Harris, with input from Planned Parenthood{{snd}}which sponsored the bill{{snd}}making it a criminal offense to intentionally distribute, or to help with the dissemination of, unlawfully obtained confidential communications.<ref name=Criminalize>{{cite news|author=Alexandra Desantis|title=California Governor Signs Bill to Criminalize Whistleblowing|publisher=National Review|date=September 20, 2016}}</ref><ref name=AB1671>{{cite news|title=AB-1671 Confidential communications: disclosure|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1671|publisher=California Legislative Information|date=September 30, 2016}}</ref> [[Libertarianism in the United States|Libertarians]], filmmakers and news organizations vehemently opposed the bill which was signed into law after late amendments were added to it.<ref name=BadBill>{{cite news|author=Editorial|title=Planned Parenthood's Bad Bill|work=LA Times|date=August 31, 2016}}</ref>

Harris, along with candidates [[Cory Booker]], [[Julian Castro]], [[Tulsi Gabbard]], [[Kirsten Gillibrand]], [[Amy Klobuchar]], [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Elizabeth Warren]], and [[Marianne Williamson]], has explicitly discouraged single-candidate super PACs from operating on her behalf, though she cannot prevent them from doing so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://readsludge.com/2019/04/01/where-the-2020-candidates-stand-on-campaign-finance/|title=Where the 2020 Candidates Stand on Campaign Finance|first=Alex |last=Kotch |date=April 1, 2019 |website=Sludge|access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref>

In the first quarter of 2019, nearly 40% of Harris's donations came from small donors (donations of less than $200), while over 60% of her donations came from large donors (donations of $200 or more).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-fundraising-idUSKCN1RS0A9 |first=Ginger |last=Gibson |first2=Amanda |last2=Becker |first3=Grant |last3=Smith |title=Most Democratic presidential hopefuls still relying on large campaign donations |work=[[Reuters]] |date=April 16, 2019 |accessdate=April 22, 2020 }}</ref>

In April 2018, following reports that the Justice Department was blocking the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] from taking action on over two dozen requests to grow marijuana for use in research, Harris and Republican [[Orrin Hatch]] sent a letter to Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] on the necessity of marijuana research "for evidence-based decision making" and "to resolve critical questions of public health and safety, such as learning the impacts of marijuana on developing brains and formulating methods to test marijuana impairment in drivers."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/public-global-health/382858-hatch-harris-call-for-doj-to-stop-blocking-medical|title=Senators call for DOJ to stop blocking medical marijuana research|date=April 12, 2018|first=Nathaniel|last=Weixel|publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

In May 2018, Harris announced she would co-sponsor the [[Marijuana Justice Act]] (originally introduced by Senator [[Cory Booker]] in August 2017) which would legalize cannabis at the federal level by removing it from the [[Controlled Substance Act]].

In July 2019, Harris and Representative [[Jerry Nadler]] introduced the [[MORE Act|Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act]] of 2019, legislation that would legalize marijuana on the federal level in addition to expunging low-level marijuana possession convictions and authorizing grants to members of communities of color as part of an effort to reverse decades of damage cannabis criminalization had inflicted to those respective communities. In a statement, Harris cited the need to regulate marijuana and ensuring "everyone — especially communities of color that have been disproportionately impacted by the War on Drugs — has a real opportunity to participate in this growing industry."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/kamala-harris-marijuana-bill-legalize-tax-weed-pot-862192/|title=Sen.

In October 2017, Harris was one of nineteen senators to sign a letter to [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Scott Pruitt]] questioning Pruitt's decision to repeal the [[Clean Power Plan]], asserting that the repeal's proposal used "mathematical sleights of hand to over-state the costs of industry compliance with the 2015 Rule and understate the benefits that will be lost if the 2017 repeal is finalized" and science denying and math fabricating would fail to "satisfy the requirements of the law, nor will it slow the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the inexorable rise in sea levels, or the other dire effects of global warming that our planet is already experiencing."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/357446-19-sens-question-epa-methodology-behind-clean-power-plan-repeal |date=October 26, 2017 |title=19 sens question EPA methodology behind Clean Power Plan repeal|first=Julia|last=Manchester|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

=== Trade ===
In May 2019, Harris stated she would not have voted for the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) due to her belief that "we can do a better job to protect American workers" and called for the United States to do "a better job in terms of thinking about the priorities that should be more apparent now than perhaps they were then, which are issues like the climate crisis and what we need to build into these trade agreements."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/443314-kamala-harris-says-she-wouldnt-have-voted-for-nafta|title=Kamala Harris says she wouldn't have voted for NAFTA|date=May 12, 2019|first=Zack|last=Budryk|publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

=== Voting rights ===
