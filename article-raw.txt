Harris reportedly clashed with Hallinan's new chief assistant, Darrell Salomon{{snd}}a former personal attorney to [[Dianne Feinstein|Senator Dianne Feinstein]] with connections to City Hall, but no criminal prosecuting experience.<ref name="Quits" /><ref name="TopAide">{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Hartlaub|title=DA's top aide quits among turmoil|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=August 21, 2000}}</ref> Salomon was appointed in January after the previous chief, Richard Iglehart, was appointed to become a Superior Court Judge.<ref name="Assistant">{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Hartlaub|title=Hallinan picks City Hall insider as Assistant|url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Hallinan-picks-City-Hall-insider-as-assistant-3080004.php |newspaper=The San Francisco Examiner|date=January 13, 2000}}</ref>[[File:Kamala Harris (46823600565).jpg|thumb|National Forum on Wages and Working People, 2019]]Salomon's appointment coincided with the introduction of a [[California ballot proposition|state ballot measure]]{{snd}}[[2000 California Proposition 21|Prop 21]]{{snd}}which would be voted on in an election held in three months.<ref name="Kayo">{{cite news |url=https://www.theava.com/archives/96387 |last=Fred |first=Gardener|title=Kamala vs. Kayo (2003)|work=[[Anderson Valley Advertiser]]|location=Boonville, CA |publisher=Bruce Anderson, editor and publisher |date=February 13, 2019}}</ref>  The proposition would grant prosecutors the option of trying [[Minor (law)|juvenile]] defendants in Superior Court rather than juvenile courts.  This authority was usually only granted to judges and could have had a big impact in San Francisco where drug violations accounted for nearly 70% of prosecuted crimes.<ref name=Kayo/> Harris opposed the measure, as did Hallinan, who was the only District Attorney in the state to oppose the measure.<ref name=Kayo/>

Harris, concerned about the possibility of nearly 40,000 kids per year{{snd}}mostly [[Minority group#Involuntary minorities|minority]]{{snd}}being tried in adult court, became very involved in campaigning against the measure, including attending rallies as a speaker, writing position papers and volunteering for the "No-On-21" campaign on weekends.<ref name=Kayo/> Her knowledge and commitment to the issue was such that the District Attorney's Public Information Officer at the time, Fred Gardner, would give reporters the option to interview both Harris and Hallinan. However, doing so reportedly made Hallinan paranoid that Harris was trying to usurp him in preparation of challenging him for the next election (in 2003).<ref name=Kayo/> Salomon approached Gardner and allegedly accused him of helping Harris: "You're trying to make a star out of Kamala Harris."<ref name=Kayo/> Gardner dismissed the accusation, noting that "she [Harris] is already a star," and was then reportedly told by Salomon to stop directing Prop 21 media inquiries to Harris as he believed Harris had "an agenda" given she was "Willie Brown's protege."<ref name=Kayo/>

Gardner inquired if she was planning to run in 2003. She reportedly replied that it would be "unprofessional" to run against Hallinan if he decided to run for a third term.<ref name=Kayo/> Gardner relayed Harris' response to Hallinan.  However, Gardner stated that Hallinan "did not believe her."<ref name=Kayo/>  Hallinan then ordered that all calls from reporters, not only those pertaining to Prop 21, go directly to him: "I'm the elected official.  I'm the D.A. It's my office. Except for my spokesman, I don't want anybody going to the media."<ref name=Kayo/> Hallinan retaliated and reassigned Harris, which Harris believed to be a ''[[de facto]]'' demotion, and set a [[canary trap]] to test her loyalty by divulging supposedly confidential information to her and watching to see if was leaked to the media.<ref name=Kayo/>  It was, but the leaker turned out to be Hallinan himself, not Harris.<ref name=Kayo/>

Shortly after her reassignment, Harris was a part of a group of supervisors who confronted Hallinan about Salomon, seeking to "overthrow" him.<ref name=Karma/> However, when their attempt failed, Harris then filed a complaint against Salomon and quit.<ref name=Quits/><ref name=Karma/> The spokesman for the District Attorney's office called Harris' defection "a sad day [because Harris was] a good lawyer, well-liked and brilliant."<ref name=Quits/> Salomon resigned two weeks after Harris left, blaming her for "stirring up resentment" against him.<ref name=TopAide/>

In August 2000, Harris took a new job at [[San Francisco City Hall]], working for elected [[City Attorney]] [[Louise Renne]].<ref name=Quits/> Renne hired Harris to take the place of [[Katherine Feinstein]], after Feinstein was appointed as a [[Alameda County Superior Court|Superior Court Judge]].<ref name=Quits/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womensradio.com/articles/This-DA-Makes-a-Difference-for-Women/559.html |title=Women's Radio: This DA Makes a Difference For Women |publisher=Womensradio.com |accessdate=November 18, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219095441/http://www.womensradio.com/articles/This-DA-Makes-a-Difference-for-Women/559.html |archivedate=December 19, 2010}}</ref><ref name=Quits/>  Harris ran the Family and Children's Services Division representing child abuse and [[Child neglect|neglect]] cases, domestic violence, building code enforcement, and public health matters.<ref name=Karma/><ref name=Quits/>  Renne said of Harris:

===2003 Campaign for District Attorney===
====Campaign organization====
[[File:Congresswoman Pelosi meets San Francisco's District Attorney, Kamala Harris; March 30, 2004.jpg|thumb|Harris with Congresswoman [[Nancy Pelosi]], 2004]]
Harris was reportedly so angry about the discontent in Terence Hallinan's office that she decided to run against him.<ref name=Karma/>  She began "methodically gathering support" by attending political events, volunteering on other campaigns, assuming [[Board of directors|board memberships]] on nonprofits, being seen at exclusive parties, and presenting herself as an alternative to a "political has-been."<ref name=Karma/> When Harris announced her candidacy, she had served on the board of trustees of the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco]], had been a member of [[SFJAZZ Center|San Francisco Jazz Organization]], was a patron dinner chair for the [[San Francisco Symphony|San Francisco Symphony's]] Black & White Ball, was the executive director of the San Francisco Domestic Violence Consortium, led the board of directors of Partners Ending Domestic Abuse, and was a board member of nonprofit, Women Count.<ref name=Launched/>

{{quote|"...people wanted to be able to say they’d met her and were supporting her because of this quasi-social network that we started with, and the more she raised, and the more she got traction, the more everybody else wanted to say they heard her, they talked to her and were supportive...but they were kind of professional [[socialite]]s, and they wanted to help her. They saw it as a two-way street."<ref name=Launched/> –– Sharon Owsley, ''Socialite and Attorney''}}

In mid-2002, Harris called Mark Buell, the stepfather of her friend, [[Walker family|Summer Tompkins Walker]], and told him of her intention to run for District Attorney against the two-term incumbent{{snd}}and her former boss.<ref name=Launched/>  Buell was married to major Democratic megadonor, [[Susie Tompkins Buell]].  He was doubtful of Harris' candidacy as he had only thought of her as "a socialite with a law degree"  However, Buell, impressed by Harris, offered to be her [[Political campaign staff|finance chair]].<ref name=Launched/> Buell advised that to beat an incumbent, Harris would need to raise more than $150,000, the highest amount ever raised to campaign for the position.  He and Harris organized a finance committee composed mostly of Harris' friends, who were "young socialite ladies".<ref name=Launched/>  The committee included [[Getty family|Vanessa Getty]] and [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art#Elected Trustees|Susan Swig]].

Harris also sought to run a campaign that disrupted negative [[Stereotypes of African Americans|stereotypes of black women]] <ref name=Karma/><ref name=Karma/> and set up her campaign office in [[Bayview–Hunters Point, San Francisco|Bayview]]{{snd}}the "most isolated neighborhood" in San Francisco.<ref name=Launched/>{{snd}}Running against two-term incumbent and former boss, Terence Hallinan, and defense attorney, Bill Fazio, Harris was the least known candidate among the three, but noted to be "whip-smart, hard-working, and well-credentialed." <ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Nina|title=Why Kamala Matters|url=http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/why-kamala-matters|accessdate=May 12, 2015|work=San Francisco Magazine|date=August 2007 |archive-date=February 15, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215203550/http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/why-kamala-matters }}</ref><ref name=Continue>{{cite news|first=Alison |last=Soltau|title=Panel rules DA candidate can continue spending|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=October 16, 2003}}</ref>

Hallinan and Fazio sought to [[Cronyism|link Harris to Willie Brown]], who was openly campaigning and fundraising for Harris, through a [[Political action committee|PAC]]{{snd}}California Voter Project{{snd}}though reportedly without her consent.<ref name=Karma>{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Byrne |title=Kamala's Karma |newspaper=San Francisco Weekly |accessdate=April 22, 2020 |date=September 24, 2003|url=https://www.sfweekly.com/news/kamalas-karma/ }}</ref> Harris denied financially benefitting from Brown. However, Mark Buell later admitted that he met with Brown for lunch and Brown volunteered a campaign tactic to him.<ref name=Karma/> Buell also admitted that Brown personally donated $500{{snd}}the individual donation maximum{{snd}}to Harris after [[Walker family|Summer Tompkins Walker]] reportedly asked Brown to donate while at a restaurant.<ref name=Karma/>

However, Harris supporters said that statements used to tie her to Willie Brown were [[Misogyny|misogynistic]]. Harris' sister, Maya, asked: "When a woman dates an accomplished man, why are people so willing to assume it's only because of him that the woman is successful?" <ref name=Karma/>  Harris' mother stated:

{{quote|"What has Willie Brown done for her?  Introduce her to society people when they dated?  If they did not like Kamala on her own right, they would have dropped her after she dropped Willie.  Kamala is comfortable in all kinds of social scenes.  She can pull it off in [[High society (social class)|high society]], too. She has the manners, the eating habits."<ref name=Karma/>}}

Harris' campaign later successfully lobbied the 24-member [[California Democratic Party#County central committees|Central Committee]]{{snd}}including U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein and then-House Majority leader [[Nancy Pelosi]]{{snd}}of the statewide Democratic party to deny their influential endorsement to either of Harris' competitors.<ref name=Karma/>  It was the first time the Central Committee had withheld its endorsement from an incumbent.

====Campaign spending violation====
[[File:Kamala Harris (5122897990).jpg|thumb|right|Rally at [[University of Southern California|USC]], 2010]]
Harris was found to be guilty, by the city's Ethics Commission, of violating campaign spending limit of $211,000, of which Harris had agreed to abide by before the campaign commenced.<ref name=Continue/>  Harris had overspent the pledged amount by nearly $100,000.  The Commission's own staff was later accused of abusing its discretion, and favoring Harris, when it retroactively lifted the campaign spending limit after Harris' campaign had spent over the limit, and when Harris' campaign said that it was recognizing the Commission as the authority of the limit's forms rather than the Department of Elections.<ref name=Continue/>  The Commission denied the accusations, saying that its staff acted with its authority under local law.<ref name=Continue/>

Harris' supporters said her campaign mistakenly violated the spending cap due to a "misinterpretation of confusing law changes" on the forms.<ref name=Continue/> They also argued that the cap put lesser-known candidates at a disadvantage, which was unfair since Harris had to spend more to increase her profile.  However, critics charged that the forms were straightforward for any attorney to understand.  Critics were also adamant that Harris willfully violated the spending cap and argued that, even if Harris mistakenly overspent the cap, that doing so was indefensible under the law.<ref name=Continue/>

Harris ran a "Notice to Voters" in newspapers stating that she never agreed to limit her campaign spending, but said her failure to file the form (to decline the campaign spending cap) on time on was "due to errors by her campaign."<ref name=Notice>{{cite news|first=Kamala|last=Harris|title=Notice to Voters|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=October 20, 2003}}</ref>  Harris' campaign lawyer also argued that the spending cap violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].  Harris' campaign was questioned on why she would agree to the spending limit if it was, in fact, unconstitutional.  Harris' campaign responded that political candidates face political pressure "to accept rules that hinder their constitutional rights."<ref name=Continue/>

Harris was fined nearly $35,000 by the Commission and ordered to alert voters, in her mailers, that she had violated the spending limit.  The mailers, subsequently produced by her campaign, were said to have displayed her spending violation with "the smallest font in America."<ref name=Continue/>

Harris, who the [[San Francisco Examiner]] called "a relative unknown", went on to spend nearly $625,000 throughout the campaign while Hallinan spent just over $285,000.<ref name=Ousts>{{cite news|first1=Alison|last1=Soltau|first2=Ethan|last2=Fletcher|title=Harris ousts veteran Hallinan|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=December 10, 2003}}</ref>  It was more than four times more than any candidate had raised in the history of running for the office.<ref name=Launched/>

====Runoff election====
[[File:MS5 1047 0.jpg|thumb|[[Baldwin Hills, Los Angeles|Baldwin Hills]], 2014]]
Harris ran a "forceful" campaign, assisted with the political and personal backing of former mayor [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]] and securing "an impressive array" of endorsements, including from Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]], Sheriff [[Michael Hennessey]], writer and cartoonist [[Aaron McGruder]], and comedians [[Eddie Griffin]] and [[Chris Rock]].<ref name=Ousts/><ref name=Sunset>{{cite news|first=Adriel|last=Hampton|title=Harris stumps in the Sunset|work=The San Francisco Examiner|date=July 28, 2003}}</ref><ref name=Celebs>{{cite news|first1=J.K.|last1=Dineen|first2=Adriel|last2=Hampton|title=Clinton Tops List of Celebrity Supporters |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/462679876/ |work=The San Francisco Examiner|date=December 9, 2003}}</ref> Bill Fazio had been eliminated from the election after initial voting. Hallinan and Harris, who garnered 37% and 33% of the vote, respectively, would have a [[Two-round system|runoff]].<ref name=Runoff>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200422151156/https://napavalleyregister.com/news/two-to-duel-in-sf-mayor-runoff-vallejo-s-intinoli/article_74c086c0-13e6-50d6-800f-60793f1521ee.html |url-status=live |url=https://napavalleyregister.com/news/two-to-duel-in-sf-mayor-runoff-vallejo-s-intinoli/article_74c086c0-13e6-50d6-800f-60793f1521ee.html |title=Two to Duel in SF Mayor Runoff; Vallejo Intinoli's Win|work=The Napa Valley Register|date=November 5, 2003|archive-date=April 22, 2020 }}</ref>

Rumored to have worked 16 hours per day on her campaign, Harris was lauded for her campaigning skills, particularly for "listen[ing] carefully to the concerns of ordinary people."<ref name=Karma/> In the runoff, Harris sought to differentiate her policy positions from those of Hallinan, as it was a "problem" that they ideologically agreed on key issues such as being against the use of the [[capital punishment|death penalty]].<ref name=Karma/>  Harris ran on making the [[sexual abuse]] of children her top issue.<ref name=Struggle>{{cite news|first=Adriel|last=Hampton|title=Kamala Harris' struggle for self-definition |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/templates/story.cfm?displaystory=1&storyname=102803n_harris |work=The San Francisco Examiner|date=October 28, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031226151009/http://www.sfexaminer.com/templates/story.cfm?displaystory=1&storyname=102803n_harris |archive-date=December 26, 2003 }}</ref>  She charged that, though she worked for Hallinan for two years, she left his office because it was "dysfunctional," technologically inept and was "a mess."  She attacked Hallinan for promoting people in his office without [[Meritocracy|merit]], for his "abysmal" conviction rate for [[felony|serious crimes]] (at just under 65%){{snd}}over 10 percent lower than [[Arlo Smith|his predecessor's]] rate{{snd}}lowering office morale, and for his willingness to accept [[Plea bargaining in the United States|plea bargains]] in cases of [[domestic violence]]:<ref name=Ousts/><ref name=Struggle/><ref name=Karma/>

{{quote|"It is not progressive to be soft on crime."<ref name=Karma/> –– Kamala Harris, 2003}}

Hallinan refuted that Harris was misrepresenting his office.  For example, he stated the decrease in [[conviction rate]] was not due to the performance of his office, but because of a [[diversion program]] that he created for criminals.<ref name=Karma/>

Harris also accrued negative publicity. Being [[upper middle class]] she was portrayed as being out of touch with her self-described "black base."<ref name=Karma/> She reportedly told a group of affluent blacks at [[Yerba Buena Gardens]], along with affluent whites in Pacific Heights, "The most victimized people do not vote, so you have to act on their behalf."<ref name=Karma/> Also, while talking to three black men, outside of a [[Visitacion Valley, San Francisco|Sunnydale]] [[Subsidized housing in the United States|housing project]], who planned to protest [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|the Muni transit system]] for not honoring its promise to hire young blacks to work on a new [[Light rail in the United States|light-rail system]], Harris suggested they "ask a police captain to conduct a protest training [so] you can protest safely." The organizer of the protest, Harold Kyer, was reportedly embarrassed to have to explain to Harris that her suggestion was naive:

{{quote|"Our community is not police-friendly, Ms. Harris. They will not come to a meeting if the police show up."<ref name=Karma/>}}

Harris faced additional criticism. Her support of Proposition M, which would increase criminal penalties for [[Begging|panhandling]] without providing funds for housing or health services for the homeless, conflicted with her [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] platform. However, the stance aligned her with Mayoral candidate, [[Gavin Newsom]], whose campaign was supporting the initiative. Harris was also criticized, near the end of the campaign, for holding a press conference in which she vocalized a case about a woman who was tortured by her boyfriend with a hot iron, in order to attack Hallinan's record on [[domestic violence]].<ref name=Respect>{{cite news|first=Adriel|last=Hampton|title=Domestic violence victim says DA Hallinan showed respect|work=The San Francisco Examiner|date=December 8, 2003}}</ref>  Harris did not talk to, or consult with, the victim prior to citing the case.  However, Hallinan did speak with the victim and her family.  The victim subsequently praised Hallinan for "respect[ing] her desire not to have the case become a media spectacle."  Harris was accused of politicizing the victim.<ref name=Respect/>

Harris won with 56.33% of the vote and became the first woman to lead the District Attorney's Office of San Francisco.<ref name=Ousts/>

===Conviction rate ===
[[File:AG Kamala Harris.jpg|thumb|Attorney General, 2010]]
While Harris was the [[San Francisco District Attorney's Office|San Francisco District Attorney]], the overall felony conviction rate rose from 52% in 2003 to 67% in 2006, the highest in a decade; there was an 85% conviction rate for homicides, and convictions of drug dealers increased from 56% in 2003 to 74% in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kamalaharris.org/issues/34 |title=Convicting Felons – Kamala Harris |date=January 3, 2008 |access-date=April 19, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103072145/http://www.kamalaharris.org/issues/34 |website=kamalaharris.org |archivedate=January 3, 2008 }}</ref>

When Harris took office, she cleared part of the murder caseload from the previous administration. She stated that the records from that administration were less than ideal, and worked to get convictions on what she could. Out of the 73 homicide cases backlogged, over 40% of them took deals for lesser charges, such as [[manslaughter]], pleaded to other crimes, such as [[assault]] or [[burglary]] while the murder charges were dismissed.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jaxon|last=Van Derbeken|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-03-20/news/17287759_1_conviction-handling-of-criminal-cases-homicide/4|title=Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=March 20, 2006|page=4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118160154/http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-03-20/news/17287759_1_conviction-handling-of-criminal-cases-homicide/4 |archive-date=January 18, 2012 }}</ref>

In 2009, Harris' prosecutors won a lower percentage of their [[felony]] jury trials than their counterparts at district attorneys' offices covering the 10 largest cities in California. Her at-trial felony conviction rate that year was 76 percent, down 12 percent from the previous year, was more than 5 percent under the statewide average.<ref name="Lack of Conviction">{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Jamison|url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/a-lack-of-conviction/Content?oid=2177022 |title=A Lack of Conviction|newspaper=[[SF Weekly]]|date=May 5, 2010|accessdate=March 9, 2019}}</ref>

In 2012, Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo ruled that Harris's office violated defendants' rights by hiding damaging information about a San Francisco Police Department crime lab technician, that Harris' office had ignored a constitutional obligation to turn over to defense attorneys the criminal histories of police testifying at trial, and that Harris' office was indifferent to demands that it account for its failings.<ref name="SFVanDerbeken">{{cite news|first=Jaxon|last=Van Derbeken|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Judge-rips-Harris-office-for-hiding-problems-3263797.php |title=Judge rips Harris' office for hiding problems|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=July 28, 2010}}</ref><ref name=Secrecy>{{cite news|first=Matt |last=Smith |title=A Secrecy Fetish|url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/a-secrecy-fetish/Content?oid=2177326 |accessdate=April 22, 2020 |work=San Francisco Weekly |date=June 2, 2010}}</ref>

===Criminal justice reform===
In 2004, Harris recruited civil rights activist [[Lateefah Simon]], the youngest woman to ever receive a [[MacArthur Fellowship]] for her leadership of the Center for Young Women's Development, to create San Francisco Reentry Division.  The flagship program for the division was the Back on Track initiative, a first of its kind reentry program for young adults charged with low-level drug sales. Initiative participants, age 18-30 who were nonviolent, first-time offenders whose crimes were not weapon or gang-related would plead guilty in exchange for a deferral of sentencing and regular appearances before a judge over a 12 to 18-month period. The program maintained rigorous graduation requirements, mandating successful completion of up to 220 hours of community service, obtaining a [[High school equivalency degree|high-school-equivalency diploma]], maintaining steady employment, taking parenting classes, and passing drug tests. At graduation, the court would dismiss the original case and leave the graduate with a clean record.<ref name="Fraley">{{cite web|first=Malaika|last=Fraley|url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2009/10/26/book-em-kamala-s-f-district-attorney-harris-adds-author-to-list-of-credits/|title=Book 'em, Kamala{{snd}}S.F.

Over six years, Harris' pioneer program produced over 200 graduates, and achieved a very low [[recidivism]] rate: less than 10 percent, compared to 53 percent of California's drug offenders that returned to prison within two years of release. Back on Track earned recognition from the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] as a model for reentry programs. The DOJ also noted that the cost to the taxpayers per participant was markedly lower ($5,000) than the cost of adjudicating a case and housing a low-level offender in jail - $10,000 and $50,000, respectively.<ref>{{cite web | url=

In 2009, a state law (the Back on Track Reentry Act, A.B. 750) was enacted, encouraging other California counties to start programs around a similar model.

====Opposition to the death penalty====
In April 2004, [[San Francisco Police Department]] Officer Isaac Espinoza was shot and killed in the line of duty. Three days later, Harris announced she would not seek the [[death penalty]], angering the [[San Francisco Police Officers Association]]. During Espinoza's funeral at [[Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption (San Francisco, California)|St. Mary's Cathedral]], U.S. Senator and former San Francisco mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]], in a surprise move, rose to the pulpit and called on Harris, who was sitting in the front pew, to secure the death penalty, prompting a standing ovation from the 2,000 uniformed police officers in attendance. Immediately thereafter, Association President Gary Delagnes took the pulpit, reversed his earlier backing of Harris' decision not to seek the death penalty and demanded that Espinoza's killer "pay the ultimate price." Delagnes received another standing ovation. After the funeral, Feinstein said that had she known Harris was against the death penalty, she  wouldn't have endorsed her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Feinstein-s-surprise-call-for-death-penalty-puts-3313728.php |title=Feinstein's surprise call for death penalty puts D.A. on spot|website=San Francisco Chronicle |date=April 21, 2004 |accessdate=May 3, 2020}}</ref> Despite immense political pressure from members of California's political establishment, including U.S. Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] and Oakland Mayor [[Jerry Brown]], Harris still refused.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Sen-Boxer-joins-throng-calling-for-death-in-3324378.php |title=Sen.

=== Crimes against children===
[[File:Kamala Harris.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Dept. of Justice, 2013]]

In 2004, Harris created a new unit in the district attorney's office dedicated to prosecuting child assault crimes, staffed by two prosecutors already assigned to the sexual assault detail.  The goal of the unit, Harris said, is to improve education and outreach at schools and have specially trained prosecutors deal with all child victims of both sexual and physical attacks.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jaxon|last=Van Derbeken|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=107007E1EB4A3010&p_docnum=10&s_dlid=DL0120050202495811073&s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&s_trackval=&s_siteloc=&s_referrer=&s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F15%2F2030&s_docsbal=%20&s_subexpires=12%2F15%2F2030&s_docstart=&s_docsleft=&s_docsread=&s_username=refuser&s_accountid=AC0114070818394531470&s_upgradeable=no|title=D.A. creating unit to fight child assaults|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=December 15, 2004|accessdate=May 1, 2020}}</ref>Harris, alongside Supervisor [[Tom Ammiano]] established a first-of-its-kind safe house and school for former [[child prostitutes]] and abuse victims to attend school and obtain counseling in partnership with the nearby Edgewood Center for Children and non-profit Standing Against Global Exploitation (SAGE) founded by anti sex trafficking activist [[Norma Hotaling]] <ref>{{cite news|first=Heather|last=Knight|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-A-home-for-ex-child-prostitutes-2576562.php|title=SAN FRANCISCO / A home for ex-child prostitutes / Girls will also get counseling and go to school nearby|newspaper=[[SF Gate]]|date=October 4, 2005|accessdate=May 5, 2020}}</ref> 

In 2004, Joey Piscitelli, a private litigant suing the church overseeing his high school, requested assistance from the district attorney's office to build his case.  Piscitelli alleged he was repeatedly [[rape]]d by the principal of his school in the 1970s. At the time, civil litigation was the only avenue for [[restitution]] available to victims following a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision [[Stogner v. California|overturning a California law]] that retroactively eliminated the [[statute of limitations]] for criminal prosecution of child molestation cases.<ref name=Cooperating>{{cite news|first=Lee |last=Fang|title=As San Francisco District Attorney, Kamala Harris's Office Stopped Cooperating with Victims of Catholic Church Child Abuse |url=https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/kamala-harris-san-francisco-catholic-church-child-abuse/ |accessdate=April 22, 2020 |work=[[The Intercept]] |date=June 9, 2019}}</ref>  Many sexual abusers who were facing criminal charges prior to the ruling were set free, including Piscitelli's alleged assailant.<ref name=Cooperating/><ref name=Keegan>{{cite news|first=Richard |last=Somerville |agency=Associated Press|title=Accused priest to walk free|url=https://www.theunion.com/news/local-news/accused-priest-to-walk-free/ |accessdate=April 22, 2020 |work=The Union|date=June 27, 2003}}</ref> Piscitelli sued under a new 2003 statute passed by the California legislature that allowed victims to file civil lawsuits against their alleged abusers if they could prove that the employers of the abusers knew of the misconduct and did nothing to stop it.<ref>{{cite news|first=Trey|last=Bundy|title=Survivors of Priest Abuse Make Proposal to Church|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/us/24bcclergy.html|accessdate=May 1, 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 23, 2011}}</ref> Piscitelli claimed the district attorney's office did not respond to his letters or calls, and would not allow him to access the files. He sought help from the media, which requested access to the files under [[California Public Records Act|California's Public Records Act]], but was denied because investigative files related to ongoing matters "were not subject to California's government transparency laws."<ref name=Secrecy/> In 2010, Harris's office released a statement:

{{quote|"District Attorney Harris focuses her efforts on putting child molesters in prison. We're not interested in selling out our victims to look good in the paper. When this case was brought under Terence Hallinan, prosecutors took the utmost care to protect the identity and dignity of the victims.

In 2005, Harris announced the arrest of Maureen Faibish, mother of 12-year old Nicholas Faibish on charges of felony [[child endangerment]].  Faibish left her son alone in a basement to run errands in the family's Inner Sunset district home, separated from the family's pit bull dogs by a door she had secured with a propped shovel. When Faibish returned two hours later, Nicholas' body was in a front bedroom, having suffered severe facial injuries and had a hole in his scalp.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jaxon|last=Van Derbeken|url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Mom-jailed-in-pit-bulls-fatal-mauling-of-son-2626296.php|title=Mom jailed in pit bulls' fatal mauling of son / She is charged with child endangerment for leaving 12-year-old boy alone with dogs|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 24, 2005|accessdate=May 2, 2020}}</ref> Faibish pleaded not guilty and took the case to trial.  The jury deadlocked, with 10 of the 12 panelists in favor of acquittal on the felony charge, and split 7-5 for conviction on misdemeanor child endangerment; the court declared a mistrial.

Later that year, Harris' office brought three charges of murder with special circumstances against LaShaun Harris, who was seen her young sons - age 2, 6, and 16 months -  into the San Francisco Bay.<ref name="NBCAP">{{cite news|title=San Francisco mom pleads innocent to murder|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/9758632/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/san-francisco-mom-pleads-innocent-murder/|accessdate=May 2, 2020 |publisher=NBC News|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=August 1, 2006}}</ref>  LaShaun Harris, a paranoid schizophrenic, pleaded innocent to three counts of murder, stating that "she had carried out God's will."<ref name="NBCAP" /> A jury found her guilty of second-degree murder, but the judge ruled that Harris was insane and ordered her hospitalized for 25 years to life.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mom who threw kids in bay declared insane|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16674425/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/mom-who-threw-kids-bay-declared-insane/|accessdate=May 2, 2020|publisher=NBC News|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=August 1, 2006}}</ref> The conviction was later upheld on appeal.<ref>{{cite news|title=Court upholds convictions of S.F. mother who threw three sons into the bay|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2010/07/01/court-uphold-convictions-of-s-f-mother-who-threw-three-sons-into-the-bay/|accessdate=May 2, 2020 |work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=July 1, 2010}}</ref>

In 2008, Harris worked with Assemblyman [[Mark Leno]] to draft legislation that provided young bystanders to violent crime up to $5,000 in mental health services. The legislation, AB2809, allows young bystanders to access funding from the state's Victim Compensation Program for treatment of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Harris said: "For too many children, seeing shootings or stabbings in their neighborhoods is far too common. Before this law, there was no help." Leno's bill was signed into law by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Jill|last=Tucker|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=12391D794AF851B0&p_docnum=24&s_dlid=DL0120050216352427816&s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&s_trackval=&s_siteloc=&s_referrer=&s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F15%2F2030&s_docsbal=%20&s_subexpires=12%2F15%2F2030&s_docstart=&s_docsleft=&s_docsread=&s_username=refuser&s_accountid=AC0114070818394531470&s_upgradeable=no|title=State to aid young witnesses of violent crime|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 2, 2008|accessdate=May 2, 2020}}</ref>

====Truancy initiative====
In 2006, Harris led a city-wide effort with Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]], Police Chief [[Heather Fong]], and various local leaders to combat [[truancy]] for at-risk youth in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Heather|last=Knight|title=City opens campaign to cut truancy by thousands of students|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=105D3AF9CE92404E&p_docnum=16&s_dlid=DL0120050214473400976&s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&s_trackval=&s_siteloc=&s_referrer=&s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F15%2F2030&s_docsbal=%20&s_subexpires=12%2F15%2F2030&s_docstart=&s_docsleft=&s_docsread=&s_username=refuser&s_accountid=AC0114070818394531470&s_upgradeable=no|accessdate=May 1, 2020 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 19, 2004}}</ref> The [[U.S. Department of Justice]] provided a federal grant of $225,000 supplemented with matching city fund to hire new truancy workers - social workers and child psychologists - and provide academic, social, and psychological support for chronically truant children.<ref name="Knight">{{cite news|first=Heather|last=Knight|title=City trying to get worst truants to school.

In 2008, Harris issued citations against six parents whose young children missed at least 50 days of school, the first time [[San Francisco]] prosecuted adults for student truancy. She called chronic truancy a matter of public safety and said the vast majority of prison inmates and homicide victims are dropouts or habitual truants. San Francisco's school chief, Carlos Garcia, stated that the path from truancy to parental prosecution was lengthy, and that the school district spends months encouraging parents to send their children to school through phone calls, reminder letters, private meetings, hearings before the School Attendance Review Board, and offers of help from city agencies and social services; two of the parents entered no plea but said they would work with the DA's office and social service agencies to create "parental responsibility plans" to help them start sending their children to school regularly.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nanette|last=Asimov|title=Citations go to parents of truant kids|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=1213DEC077C76F28&p_docnum=9&s_dlid=DL0120050214581526325&s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&s_trackval=&s_siteloc=&s_referrer=&s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F15%2F2030&s_docsbal=%20&s_subexpires=12%2F15%2F2030&s_docstart=&s_docsleft=&s_docsread=&s_username=refuser&s_accountid=AC0114070818394531470&s_upgradeable=no|accessdate=May 2, 2020 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 11, 2008}}</ref>

By the end of April 2009, 1,330 elementary students were habitual or chronic truants, down from 1,730 in 2008,  2,517 in 2007 and 2,856 in 2006, a staggering 23% drop since the 2005–06 school year. The district referred 110 elementary school families to a district review board, up from 34 the year before, where parents and guardians heard about the legal consequences of truancy, such as fines, and gained access to community services including parental support, mental health options and social workers. Middle school truancy saw a more modest drop of 4%, while high school truancy increased modestly by 2%. Harris said, "With noncompliant high school students, you have to prosecute them, not their parents. That sends shudders up everyone's spine." <ref name="SFGate">{{cite news|title=Fighting truancy yields big dividends

===Environmental justice===
In 2004, Harris filed charges against the Alameda Publishing Corporation, an Oakland-based newspaper group for dumping hazardous printing ink in San Francisco's [[Bayview–Hunters Point, San Francisco|Bayview]] neighborhood.  50 gallon buckets of hazardous ink were left overturned and even leaking, with identifying labels scraped off the buckets; the corporation and its publishers were charged with unlawful disposal and transportation of hazardous waste and with depositing of hazardous substances on a road.<ref>{{cite news|title=Publisher charged with illegal dumping|url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2004/12/18/publisher-charged-with-illegal-dumping-2/|accessdate=May 4, 2020 |work=[[East Bay Times]]|date=December 18, 2004}}</ref>

Later that year, Harris brought charges against four San Francisco residents for illegally trafficking in [[Haliotis rufescens|red abalone]].  Decades of poaching abalone, a seafood delicacy, had decimated local populations before local legislators cracked down on the trade.<ref>{{cite news|title=SAN FRANCISCO / 4 accused of illegal abalone trafficking / California bans sale of the popular shellfish|url=https://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-4-accused-of-illegal-abalone-2690509.php|accessdate=May 4, 2020 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 1, 2004}}</ref>

In 2005, Harris created an Environmental Crimes unit to tackle the issue,<ref>{{cite news|title=SAN FRANCISCO / D.A. creates environmental unit / 3-staff team takes on crime mostly affecting the poor|url=https://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-D-A-creates-environmental-unit-2666667.php|accessdate=May 4, 2020 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 1, 2005}}</ref> stating:

{{quote|"Crimes against the environment are crimes against communities, people who are often poor and disenfranchised. The people who live in those communities often have no other choice but to live there."}}

===Government corruption===
In 2005, Harris' office prosecuted two high-profile corruption cases involving local government officials.  Harris obtained a guilty plea from former San Francisco school official Tim Tronson for fraud and tax evasion. The allegations involved a $30 million energy retrofitting contract that the district had with a North Carolina energy company to convert heating equipment. Tronson was originally charged with 22 felony counts in connection with the alleged scheme to divert $500,000 out of a construction escrow account to be paid to an outfit under the control of another consultant, Alpha Omega Bibbs III. Bibbs then allegedly gave the money back to Tronson in the form of checks, who went to a Santa Cruz check cashing facility to convert at least $350,000 from the checks into money orders.  Tronson served four years in state prison and was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine as well as $500,000 in restitution.<ref>{{cite news|title=SAN FRANCISCO / Ex-schools official guilty of fraud, gets 4 years / Consultant oversaw construction account|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-Ex-schools-official-guilty-of-2661240.php|accessdate=May 3, 2020 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 21, 2006}}</ref>

In 2006, Republican Ed Jew won a highly competitive election to the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]]. Six months after he took office, the [[FBI]] raided his office and homes for allegedly extorting $80,000 from small business owners in his district. Shortly after the raid, Harris began investigating Jew for violating residency requirements necessary to hold his supervisor position. City Attorney [[Dennis Herrera]] also began investigations into whether Jew has violated the City Charter, which requires members of the Board of Supervisors to reside in the districts they represent for 30 days before declaring their intention to run for a position.<ref name="sfexaminer.com">{{cite news|title=Ed Jew surrenders for felony arrest, out on bail

Harris alleged that Jew lied under oath and falsified documents regarding his residency in the [[Sunset District]] so he could run for the District 4 seat for supervisor, adding that Jew has never resided at the 28th Avenue home or any other home in District 4 during his run for office. Jew maintained that he did reside at the Sunset home, dismissing suggestions that he spent most of his time at the Burlingame home his wife owns.  But records associated with the 28th Avenue house that Jew claimed as his primary residence showed that water to the home had been shut off since March 2006 and the service wasn't started in Jew's name until Sept. 2006, more than 60 days after he would have been required to live there. Facing an arrest warrant and nine felony charges ranging from perjury to voter fraud, Jew surrendered himself to Burlingame Police.<ref name="sfexaminer.com"/>

Thereafter, with the support of the Board of Supervisors, Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] suspended Jew and began the process of removing him from office.  On January 10, 2008, Jew resigned from office, swearing never to seek public office again. On October 10, 2008, Jew pleaded guilty to federal mail fraud and extortion charges and state perjury charges.  Jew was sentenced to 64 months in state prison, fined $10,000 for the federal extortion charge, and another $2000 on the perjury charge.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former S.F. supervisor pleads guilty to federal extortion, bribery, plans to accuse others|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2008%2F10%2F10%2FBARK13EVU2.DTL|accessdate=May 2, 2020 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 11, 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081011190856/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2008%2F10%2F10%2FBARK13EVU2.DTL|archive-date = October 11, 2008}}</ref>

=== Gun violence and gun-related crimes ===

In the early 2000s, the [[City and County of San Francisco]] murder rate per capita drastically outpaced the national average.  Accordingly, Harris pushed for higher bail for criminal [[defendant]]s involved in gun-related crimes, arguing that historically low [[bail]] encouraged outsiders to commit crimes in San Francisco. Officers within the [[San Francisco Police Department]] credited Harris with tightening [[loophole]]s in bail and drug programs that defendants had used in the past.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jaxon|last=Van Derbeken|url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Trials-and-tribulations-of-Kamala-Harris-D-A-2521498.php |title=Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=March 20, 2006|accessdate=March 9, 2019}}</ref>

In an effort to stem the rate of violent crimes, Harris said her prosecutors would pursue maximum penalties on gun-related crimes:<ref name="Garofoli">{{cite news|last=Garofoli|first=Joe |url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/joegarofoli/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-D-A-vows-to-go-after-gun-law-2755194.php |title=SAN FRANCISCO / D.A. vows to go after gun law violators / Harris takes tough approach, pledges maximum penalties|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=May 29, 2004|accessdate=May 2, 2020}}</ref> 
{{quote|"If you carry an illegal gun in the city of San Francisco and your case is brought to my office, you are going to spend time in jail. Period."}}

In addition to creating a gun crime unit, Harris opposed releasing defendants on their own recognizance if they were arrested on gun crimes, sought minimum 90-day sentences for possession of concealed or loaded weapons, and charged all assault weapons possession cases as felonies, adding that she would seek prison terms for criminals who possess or use assault weapons.<ref name="Garofoli"/>

{{main|Dave Dave}}

In April 2005, Harris pursued the prosecution of Charles Rothenberg a.k.a. Charley Charles, under California's [[three strikes law]] for illegal possession of a firearm.  Rothenberg became infamous in the 1980s when he set his 6-year-old son on fire amidst a custody dispute with his ex-wife.  Rothenberg previously served 6 1/2 years in prison for dousing the hotel room in kerosene and set it ablaze with his son was asleep. Having been convicted of attempted murder and arson and now illegal firearm possession, Rothernberg's act constituted a third "strike," under state law and triggering a sentence of 25 years to life in prison.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marisa |last=Lagos |url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Rothenberg-sentenced-25-years-to-life-under-2567011.php |title=Rothenberg sentenced 25 years to life under three-strike law |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=April 4, 2007 }}</ref>{{As of|2019|December|df=}}, Charles, age 79, is incarcerated at [[Mule Creek State Prison]].

In August 2007, State Assemblyman [[Mark Leno]] introduced legislation to ban gun shows at the [[Cow Palace]] in [[Daly City, CA]], joined by Harris, Police Chief [[Heather Fong]] and Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]].  City leaders contended the shows were directly contributing to the proliferation of illegal guns and spiking homicide rates in San Francisco: Mayor Newsom earlier that month signed into law local legislation banning gun shows on city and county property. Leno alleged that gun show merchants drove through the public housing developments near the arena, including Sunnydale, and illegally sold weapons to residents.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marisa |last=Lagos |url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Measure-would-ban-gun-shows-at-Cow-Palace-2526741.php |title=Measure would ban gun shows at Cow Palace

=== Hate crimes ===
[[File:Kamala Harris Img64.jpg|thumb|Pride Parade, 2013]]
As San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created a special Hate Crimes Unit, focusing on [[hate crime]]s against [[LGBT]] children and teens in schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kamalaharris.org/MarriageEquality|title=Marriage Equality|publisher=Kamalaharris.org|accessdate=November 18, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125112342/http://kamalaharris.org/MarriageEquality|archivedate=November 25, 2010}}</ref> In 2004, The [[National Urban League]] honored Harris as a "Woman of Power". In 2005, she received the [[Thurgood Marshall#Thurgood Marshall Award|Thurgood Marshall Award]] from the National Black Prosecutors Association.

{{main|Murder of Gwen Araujo}}
In early 2006, [[Gwen Araujo]], a 17-year old American Latina transgender teenager was murdered by two men who later used the "[[gay panic defense]]" before being convicted of second-degree murder. Harris, alongside Araujo's mother Sylvia Guerrero, convened a two-day conference of at least 200 prosecutors and law enforcement officials nationwide to discuss strategies to counter such legal defenses saying, "the suggestion that criminal conduct is mitigated by bias or prejudice is inappropriate. We can't outlaw it, but we can combat it."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/462922087/ |title=Harris challenges 'gay panic' strategy|page=4 |date=July 5, 2006 |newspaper=The San Francisco Examiner }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/468380490/ |title='Gay Panic:' Not an excuse |newspaper=Casper Star-Tribune |date=July 20, 2006 }}</ref>

Harris subsequently supported A.B. 1160, the Gwen Araujo Justice for Victims Act, advocating that California's penal code include jury instructions to ignore bias, sympathy, prejudice or public opinion in making their decision, also making mandatory for district attorney's offices in California to educate prosecutors about panic strategies and how to prevent bias from affecting trial outcomes.<ref name="AB 1160"/> In September 2006, California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] signed A.B. 1160 into law; the law put California on record as declaring it contrary to public policy for defendants to be acquitted or convicted of a [[lesser included offense]] on the basis of appeals to "societal bias".<ref name="AB 1160">{{cite web

In the general election, she faced [[Los Angeles County]] District Attorney [[Steve Cooley]], who led the race in polling until the final moments. Cooley ran as a nonpartisan prosecutor, distancing himself from the [[2010 California gubernatorial election|Meg Whitman campaign]]. However, during a debate on October 5, Cooley complained about the low salary of the attorney general, stating his intention to accept a pension and the salary in a practice known as "double-dipping." Harris' turned his remarks into a cutting political ad that portrayed Cooley as out-of-touch.  Cooley did not respond with a negative ad of his own until the last two weeks of the campaign, attacking Harris on her refusal to seek the death penalty in the Espinoza case.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.laweekly.com/how-steve-cooley-blew-it-the-definitive-post-mortem/ |first=Gene |last=Maddaus |title=HOW STEVE COOLEY BLEW IT: THE DEFINITIVE POST-MORTEM|work=LA Weekly|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref>

==== Law enforcement misconduct ====
In 2015, a [[California superior courts]] judge issued an order to eject all 250 prosecutors from the Orange County District Attorney's office from a high-profile mass murder case over allegations of "significant" misconduct by [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] District Attorney [[Tony Rackauckas]], who was alleged to have illegally employed jailhouse informants and concealed evidence.<ref name="NYTmag" />

The [[U.S. Department of Justice]] began an investigation into Rackauckas in December 2016, but he was not re-elected to office; his successor [[Todd Spitzer]] later stated his office willing to undergo federal probation to end the investigation <ref>{{cite news |first=Tony |last=Saavedra |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2019/02/25/new-orange-county-da-willing-to-undergo-federal-probation-to-end-snitch-investigation/|title=New Orange County DA willing to undergo federal probation to end 'snitch' investigation|date=February 25, 2019|website=TheOCRegister|accessdate=May 1, 2020}}</ref>

Harris appealed the dismissal of an indictment when it was discovered a [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] prosecutor submitted a falsified confession as court evidence.

After a rash of racially motivated police killings nationwide and immediately after being elected to her second term, Harris conducted an extensive 90-day review of [[implicit bias]] and use of force.<ref name="San Jose Mercury News">{{cite news |title=California: Kamala Harris announces police anti-bias training program|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/04/17/california-kamala-harris-announces-police-anti-bias-training-program/|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]] |date=April 17, 2015|accessdate=April 30, 2020}}</ref> In April 2015, Harris introduced the first of its kind "Principled Policing: Procedural Justice and Implicit Bias" training course, designed in conjunction with [[Stanford University]] psychologist and professor [[Jennifer Eberhardt]], to help law enforcement officers overcome barriers to neutral policing and rebuild the relationship of trust between law enforcement and the community.<ref name="San Jose Mercury News"/> All Command-level staff within the [[California Department of Justice]] received the training, while additional resources were deployed to increase the recruitment and hiring of diverse special agents and trainees.<ref name="San Jose Mercury News"/> The training was later offered to the [[California Highway Patrol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-expands-implicit-bias-and-procedural-justice|title=Attorney General Kamala D.

In September 2015, Harris, alongside Congresswoman [[Karen Bass]], [[Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD Chief]], [[Charlie Beck]], and UC Berkeley professor of public policy [[Steven Raphael]] announced the launch of OpenJustice, a first-in-the-nation criminal justice data initiative making data on deaths in law enforcement custody and use of force by law enforcement, as well as deaths of peace officers, available to the public.<ref name="oag.ca.gov">{{cite web|url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-first-its-kind-criminal-justice-open|title=Attorney General Kamala D.

[[Mitrice Richardson]] was a 24-year-old African American woman who was released from the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department in the middle of the night without any means of fending for herself. In 2016, the Attorney General opened a criminal investigation into the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]]'s handling of the Mitrice Richardson case. The AG's Office had originally declined the request of the Richardson family to investigate the case, but reversed course after the family and supporters submitted almost 500 pages of evidence to Harris's office in the hope of prompting an investigation.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news |date=February 12, 2016 |url=https://www.dailynews.com/2016/02/12/california-attorney-general-opens-criminal-investigation-into-sheriffs-department-over-mitrice-richardson-case/ |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |first=Susan |last=Abram |title=California attorney general opens criminal investigation into Sheriff's Department over Mitrice Richardson case|access-date=December 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.laweekly.com/she-went-missing-from-a-sheriffs-station-now-the-state-wants-answers/ |title=She Went Missing From a Sheriff's Station.

==== Prison conditions and sentencing reform ====
After the United States Supreme Court in ''[[Brown v. Plata]]'' (2011) declared California's prisons so overcrowded they inflicted [[cruel and unusual punishment]], Harris fought federal court supervision, explaining "I have a client, and I don't get to choose my client."<ref name="NYTmag" /> After California failed to fully implement the court's order to reduce crowding, and was ordered to implement new parole programs. The State of California appealed the decision, and in court filings the AG's office argued that if forced to release too many inmates too quickly, operations across the state which draw from prisons for their labor pool would be disrupted, such as volunteers for fighting annual [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection|wildfires]].<ref name="latimes_20141114">{{cite news|last1=St. John|first1=Paige|title=Federal judges order California to expand prison releases|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-ff-federal-judges-order-state-to-release-more-prisoners-20141114-story.html|access-date=October 12, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Neklason">{{cite magazine|first=Annika|last=Neklason|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/how-much-longer-will-inmates-fight-californias-wildfires/547628/|title=California Is Running Out of Inmates to Fight Its Fires|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|date=December 7, 2017}}</ref> Since the 1940s, qualified California inmates have the option of volunteering to receive comprehensive training from the [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection]] in exchange for sentence reductions and more comfortable prison accommodations; prison firefighters receive about $2 a day, and another $1 when battling fires.<ref>{{cite web|first=Lakshmi|last=Singh|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/11/18/669088658/serving-time-and-fighting-california-wildfires-for-2-a-day|title=Serving Time And Fighting California Wildfires|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=November 18, 2018}}</ref> However, Harris later objected to her office's argument in the prison-litigation case, telling the website ''[[ThinkProgress]]'': "The way that argument played out in court does not reflect my priorities... The idea that we incarcerate people to have indentured servants is one of the worst possible perceptions. I feel very strongly about that.

Harris declined to take any position on criminal sentencing-reform initiatives [[California Proposition 36, 2012|Proposition 36 (2012)]] and [[California Proposition 47 (2014)|Proposition 47 (2014)]], arguing it would be improper because her office prepares the ballot booklets.<ref name="NYTmag" /> Former California Attorney General [[John Van de Kamp]] considered her explanation "baloney."<ref name="NYTmag" />

====Same-sex marriage====
{{main|Hollingsworth v. Perry}}
In 2008, California voters passed [[2008 California Proposition 8|Prop 8]], a [[California ballot proposition]] and a state constitutional amendment defining marriage between a man and a woman.  Legal challenges to Prop 8 were presented by opponents quickly after its approval. Following affirmation by the state courts, two same-sex couples filed a lawsuit against the initiative in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in the case [[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]] (later [[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]).

In August 2010, Chief Judge [[Vaughn Walker]] ruled that the amendment was unconstitutional under both the [[Due Process Clause|Due Process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] Clauses of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Judge strikes down Prop. 8, allows gay marriage in California |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/08/prop8-gay-marriage.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}</ref> since it purported to ''re-remove'' rights from a disfavored class only, with no [[Rational basis review|rational basis]]. The official proponents' justifications for the measure were analyzed in over fifty pages covering eighty [[Question of fact|findings of fact]].

On February 7, 2012, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]], in a 2–1 decision, reached the same conclusion as the district court, but on narrower grounds. The court ruled that it was unconstitutional for California to grant marriage rights to same-sex couples, only to take them away shortly after. The ruling was stayed pending appeal to the United States Supreme Court.<ref name="auto16">http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2012/02/07/1016696com.pdf</ref>

On December 7, 2012, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] granted certiorari, ordering the parties to brief and argue the additional question of whether supporters of Prop. 8 have standing, i.e., a legal right to be involved in the case, under Article III, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution.<ref name="auto16"/> In February 2013, Harris filed an [[Amicus curiae]] brief with the Court, arguing that Prop 8 was unconstitutional and that initiative's sponsors did not have the right to claim to represent the interests of California by defending the law in federal court.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-files-us-supreme-court-brief-support-marriage |title=Attorney General Kamala D.

On June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court issued its decision on the appeal in the case ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'', ruling that proponents of initiatives such as Proposition 8 did not possess [[Standing (law)|legal standing]] in their own right to defend the resulting law in [[United States federal courts|federal court]], either to the Supreme Court or (previously) to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]]. Therefore, the Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Ninth Circuit, and remanded the case for further proceedings.

On June 27, 2013, Harris, in a speech delivered in downtown Los Angeles, declared that all 58 counties in California must abide by Judge Walker's 2010 ruling that declared Prop 8 unconstitutional and urging  the Ninth Circuit to lift the stay on same-sex marriages as soon as possible — even before the usual 25-day waiting period until the Supreme Court clerk notifies the lower court of its judgement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-prop-8_n_3505292|title=Kamala Harris On Prop 8 Decision: Same-Sex Marriages In California Should Begin Immediately|first=Anna|last=Almendrala|date=June 27, 2013|work=HuffPost}}</ref> The next day, the Ninth Circuit, on remand, dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and dissolved their previous stay of the district court's ruling, enabling Governor [[Jerry Brown]] to order same-sex marriages to resume.<ref name="latimes.com"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Dolan |first=Maura |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-prop-8-gay-marriage-20130628,0,1889039.story |title=Prop 8: Gay marriages can resume in California, court rules |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref> The same day, Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier, plaintiffs in the case, married with Harris officiating the ceremony.<ref>{{cite news|first=Matt|last=Baume|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-gay-marriage-resumes-20130628-story.html|title=Kamala Harris officiating Prop 8 plaintiffs' San Francisco wedding|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 28, 2013|accessdate=April 29, 2020}}</ref>

==== Transgender rights ====
In February 2014, Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, a [[transgender]] woman incarcerated at California's [[Mule Creek State Prison]], filed a federal lawsuit based on the state's failure to provide her with what she argued was medically necessary [[sex reassignment surgery]] (SRS).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/inadvfdco151116000237 |title=Jeffrey B.

In 2016, Harris filed two [[amicus curiae|amicus]] briefs in two cases supporting transgender rights. The first involved joining the [[New York Attorney General]] in opposition to the so-called [[Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act|Bathroom Bill]] in North Carolina. The second involved a case in Texas, where California joined 11 states in supporting the federal government's determination that  discrimination based on gender identity constitutes unlawful discrimination based on sex such that schools risk losing [[Title IX]] funding unless the schools permit students to use facilities consistent with their gender identity.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-urges-federal-courts-protect-transgenderr|title=Attorney General Kamala D.

==== Workers rights====
In 2012, Harris announced a $1 million settlement with the owner of eight car washes across California. The car washes, which did not have required licenses from the California Labor Commissioner to operate, routinely failed to pay minimum wage or overtime, created false records of work hours, and failed to pay money owed to employees that quit.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Thissen|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2012/01/10/san-ramon-carwash-to-pay-settlement-in-unpaid-wages-case/|title=San Ramon carwash to pay settlement in unpaid wages case|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|publisher=[[Digital First Media]]|location=San Mateo, CA|date=January 10, 2012}}</ref> At least $800,000 of the settlement went to the workers who were underpaid, with the remainder going toward taxes and penalties.<ref name="auto1"/>

In 2014, Harris reached a $4 million settlement with [[eBay]] over allegations that the company violated state anticompetitive laws by making a "no-poach" agreement with [[Intuit]] between 2006 and 2009, restricting each company's ability to recruit employees from the other company.<ref name="auto12">{{cite news|url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-reaches-4-million-settlement-ebay-over|title=Attorney General Kamala D.

In 2015, Harris signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the [[U.S. Department of Labor]]’s Wage and Hour Division to crack down on employer wage theft, facilitating the sharing of information between offices to enhance enforcement of labor violations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-partners-us-department-labor-combat-wage-theft|title=Attorney General Kamala D.

===Consumer rights advocacy ===
====For-profit colleges====
In 2013, Harris filed suit against for-profit post-secondary education company [[Corinthian Colleges]] for false advertising and deceptive marketing targeting vulnerable, low-income students and misrepresenting job placement rates to students, investors, and accreditation agencies.<ref name="auto14">{{cite web | url=

In 2011, Harris obtained the largest recovery in the history of California's False Claims Act - $241 million - with [[Quest Diagnostics]], the state's biggest provider of medical laboratory testing, of a lawsuit alleging illegal overcharges to the state's medical program for the poor.<ref name="California Department of Justice">{{cite web | url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-241-million-settlement-quest|title=Attorney General Kamala D.

Then, in 2012, Harris obtained yet another record-breaking settlement - $323 million - with the SCAN healthcare network - over excess state Medi-Cal and federal [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] payments.
The federal government received receiving $3.82 million for the Medicare portion of the settlement.

In 2014, Harris forced [[rent-to-own]] retailer [[Aaron's, Inc.]] to refund $28.4 million to California customers and pay $3.4 million in civil penalties to settle allegations that it violated California's Karnette Rental-Purchase Act by charging improper late fees, overcharging customers who paid off contracts early, and omitting important contract disclosures.<ref name="auto6">{{cite web |first=Maria|last=Armental|url=

Harris prosecuted a multitude of white collar crimes, from [[fraud]] to [[bribery]].

In 2013, Harris obtained as much as $268 million in relief for California homeowners in a settlement with [[Ocwen Financial Corporation]], part of a larger $2.1 billion settlement between the mortgage servicing giant, the federal government, and 49 states.<ref name="auto5">{{cite news |title=Sacramento homeowners to receive $20 million under settlement with Ocwen Financial|url=https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article2586881.html |first=Hudson|last=Sangree |newspaper=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=December 19, 2013}}</ref> Ocwens was alleged to have engaged in abuses such as "robo-signing" foreclosures without adequate review and "dual-tracking" customers by foreclosing on them even as the same customers were working with Ocwen to modify their loans; regulators from the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] also alleged that Ocwen also failed to promptly credit mortgage payments, miscalculated interest rates and charged borrowers improper fees.<ref name="auto5"/>

That year, Harris also declined to file a civil enforcement action against future [[U.S. Treasury Secretary]] [[Steve Mnuchin]] (then a private citizen) and his bank [[OneWest]] despite evidence "suggestive of widespread misconduct." While investigators in Harris' office recommended filing a civil enforcement action against the bank, they also noted that such an action would result in OneWest, a federally chartered bank, to assert that the state claims would be pre-empted by federal regulations imposed by the [[Dodd-Frank Act]] and trigger prolonged and costly litigation at taxpayer expense.<ref name="auto2">{{cite news |title=Kamala Harris has complicated history with Wall Street |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/26/kamala-harris-has-complicated-history-with-wall-street.html |first=Carmin |last=Chappell |publisher=CNBC |date=January 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3250383-OneWest-Package-Memo.html|title=Executive Summary – Request for Authorization to File Action against OneWest Bank, FSB OneWest Investigation (SF20122105513)|date=January 18, 2013|work=California Department of Justice}}</ref> With the law against them and protracted litigation anticipated, Harris exercised [[prosecutorial discretion]] and declined to use taxpayer dollars to pursue further action, later voting against Mnuchin's 2017 confirmation to become [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Carmin|last=Chappell|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/26/kamala-harris-has-complicated-history-with-wall-street.html|title=Kamala Harris' Complicated History with Wall Street will come under scrutiny in the 2020 race|publisher=CNBC|date=January 26, 2019}}</ref> In 2017, she said that her office's decision not to prosecute Mnuchin was based on "following the facts and the evidence...like any other case." <ref>{{cite web|first=Sylvan|last=Lane|url=https://thehill.com/policy/finance/312742-senate-democrat-defends-decision-not-to-charge-trump-treasury-pick-over |title=Dem defends decision not to charge Trump Treasury pick over foreclosures|newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=January 4, 2017}}</ref> Harris' press secretary later noted correctly that the state attorney general's office was additionally hampered by an inability to issue subpoenas due to [[OneWest Bank]]'s status as a federally chartered bank.<ref name="auto2"/> Binding [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] precedent have consistently held that  "[...] state laws that conflict with federal law are 'without effect'" ''Maryland v.

Biden expressed surprise when Harris dropped out of the race on December 3, 2019.

In late February, Biden won a landslide victory in the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary]] with the endorsement of House Whip [[Jim Clyburn]].
