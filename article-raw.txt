'''Edward Colston''' ([[1636]] &ndash; [[1721]]) was a [[Bristol]]-born English merchant, although he lived the moved to [[London]] in [[1654]] where he lived until his death, though he still provided much financial support for causes in Bristol such as education, healthcare and the church.  Today, though, he is a controversial figure in the city as a prominent part of the slave trade. He was a member of the [[Royal African Company]], which held the sole government grant for [[slavery|slave]] trading in the late 1600s.

==Colston the Merchant==

Colston was a prominent trader in sugar, shipping large quantities from the island of St. Kitts to his refinery in Bristol.

==Colston the Philanthropist==

Colston's contributions to the city of Bristol are unquestionable. He founded Colston's School in 1710 to provide education for poor boys, leaving an endownment to be managed by the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] for its upkeep.

==Colston the Slave Trader==

In 1680 Colston became a member of the [[Royal African Company]], which had held the monopoly on gold, ivory and slave trading between Britain and Africa. 

==Colston and Bristol today==
A statue was erected in Bristol in [[1895]] commemorating Colston. He was widely viewed as an inspirational figure for the city, due to his donations of vast sums of money to schools and other causes.  His name permeates the city in such landmarks as the Colston Tower, Colston Hall, Colston Hill and Colston's school.  He is also remembered, particularly in schools, by Colston's Day, on the 13th November.
Colston is a controversial figure these days in Bristol. In the [[1990]]s, knowledge of his participation in the slave trade grew. Bristol band [[Massive Attack]] refused to play at Colston Hall, and his statue has been repeatedly defaced and vandalised.
