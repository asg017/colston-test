'''Edward Colston''' (2 November 1636 – 11 October 1721) was a [[Bristol]]-born English [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trader]], merchant, and Member of Parliament. He supported and endowed schools, almshouses, hospitals and churches in Bristol, London and elsewhere, and his name is commemorated in several Bristol landmarks, streets, three schools and the [[Colston bun]]. Many of his charitable foundations still survive.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.dolphin-society.org.uk/history|title=Edward Colston, the Dolphin Society and 268 years of letter-writing…History / Background|date=2015-05-16|work=The Dolphin Society|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}</ref> A significant part of his wealth was acquired through the trade and exploitation of slaves.

==Early life==
Colston was born on 2 November 1636 in Church Street, [[Bristol]], the youngest of at least 15 children. His parents were William Colston (died 1681), a prosperous merchant who was [[High Sheriff of Bristol]] in 1643, and his wife Sarah (died 1701), daughter of Edward Batten. He was brought up in [[Bristol]] until the time of the [[English Civil War]], when he probably lived for a while on his father's estate in [[Winterbourne, South Gloucestershire|Winterbourne]], just north of the city. The family then moved to London where Edward may have been a pupil at [[Christ's Hospital]] school.<ref name="ODNB">{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5996 |title=Colston, Edward |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |last=Morgan |first=Kenneth |date=September 2004 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/5996 |accessdate=14 August 2010}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref>

==Career==
He was apprenticed to the [[Mercers Company]] for eight years and by 1672 was shipping goods from London. He built up a lucrative business, trading cloth, oil, wine, sherry and fruit with [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]] and [[Africa]].

In 1680, Colston became a member of the [[Royal African Company]], which had held the monopoly in [[Kingdom of England|England]] on trading along the [[West Africa|West coast of Africa]] in [[gold]], [[silver]], [[ivory]] and [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]] from 1662.<ref name="ODNB" /> Colston rose rapidly on to the board of the company and was Deputy Governor, its most senior executive position, from 1689 to 1690; his association with the company ended in 1692.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/colston-edward-ii-1636-1721|title=COLSTON, Edward II (1636–1721), of Mortlake, Surr. {{!}} History of Parliament Online|website=www.historyofparliamentonline.org|access-date=16 November 2016}}</ref> This company had been set up by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and his brother [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], (later King James II, who was the Governor of the company), together with [[City of London]] merchants, and it had many notable investors, including [[John Locke]], English philosopher and physician, widely regarded as one of the most influential of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers and commonly known as the "Father of Liberalism" (though he later changed his stance on the slave trade), and the diarist [[Samuel Pepys]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/restoration-18th-century-literature/articles/britains-involvement-with-new-world-slavery-and-the-transatlantic-slave-trade|title=Britain's involvement with New World slavery and the transatlantic slave trade|website=The British Library|language=en|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The sugar barons: family, corruption, empire, and war in the West Indies|last=Matthew.|first=Parker|date=2011|publisher=Walker & Co|isbn=9780802717443|location=New York|pages=126|oclc=682894539}}</ref>

During the time of Colston's involvement with the [[Royal African Company|Royal African company]] (1680 to 1692), it is estimated that the company transported around 84,000 African men, women and children, who had been traded as slaves in [[West Africa]], of whom 19,000 died on their journey to the [[Caribbean]] and the Americas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.slavevoyages.org/voyage/|title=Voyages Database|website=www.slavevoyages.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}</ref>&nbsp;Ship's crew [[mortality rate]]s were often similar and sometimes greater than the mortality rates amongst the slaves.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/atlanticslavetra0000curt/page/282|title=The Atlantic slave trade: a census|last=Curtin|first=Philip D.|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1969|isbn=0299054004|location=Madison|pages=[https://archive.org/details/atlanticslavetra0000curt/page/282 282–286]|oclc=46413}}</ref> The slaves were sold to planters for cheap labour on their [[Plantation economy|tobacco]] and, increasingly, [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantations]] who considered Africans would be more suited to the conditions than their own countrymen, as the climate resembled the climate of their homeland in [[West Africa]]. Enslaved Africans were also much less expensive to maintain than [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]] or paid [[wage labour]]ers from [[Britain]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/archaeology/caribbean/|title=Slavery in the Caribbean - International Slavery Museum, Liverpool museums|website=www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-19}}</ref>

Colston's parents had resettled in [[Bristol]] and in 1682 he made a loan to the [[Bristol Corporation|Corporation]], the following year becoming a member of the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] and a [[burgess (title)|burgess]] of the City. In 1684 he inherited his brother's mercantile business in Small Street, and was a partner in a sugar refinery in St Peter's Churchyard, shipping sugar produced by slaves from [[St Kitts]]. But he was never resident in [[Bristol]], carrying on his London business from [[Mortlake]] in Surrey until he retired in 1708.<ref name="ODNB" />

The proportion of his wealth that came from his involvement in the slave trade and slave-produced sugar is unknown, and can only be the subject of conjecture unless further evidence is unearthed.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Edward Colston and Bristol|last=Morgan|first=Kenneth|publisher=Bristol Branch of the Historical Association|year=1999|isbn=|location=Bristol|pages=3}}</ref> As well as this income, he made money from his trade in the normal commodities mentioned above, interest from [[Loan|money lending]], and, most likely, from other careful financial dealings.<ref name=":1" />

==Altruism and politics==
[[File:CromwellHouseMortlake.jpg|thumb|right|Cromwell House, [[Mortlake]], where Colston died in 1721]]
He supported and endowed schools, almshouses, hospitals and churches in Bristol, London and elsewhere. Many of his charitable foundations survive to this day.<ref name=":0" />

In [[Bristol]], he founded [[almshouse]]s in King Street and on [[St Michael on the Mount Without|St Michael's Hill]], endowed [[Queen Elizabeth's Hospital]] school and helped found [[Colston's School|Colston's Hospital]], a boarding school which opened in 1710 leaving an endowment to be managed by the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] for its upkeep. He gave money to schools in Temple (one of which went on to become [[St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School]]) and other parts of Bristol, and to several churches and the cathedral. He was a strong [[Tory]] and [[High church|high-churchman]], and was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol]] in 1710 for just one parliament.<ref name="ODNB" />

David Hughson writing in 1808 described Colston:
<blockquote>[Cromwell House was certainly the residence, in the last century, of] that excellent man Edward Colston, Esq. the great benefactor of the city of Bristol, who, in his lifetime, expended more than 10,000L. [£] in charitable institutions.''<ref name="hughson">{{cite book |last=Hughson |first=David |title=London; Being An Accurate History And Description of the British Metropolis And Its Neighbourhood, To Thirty Miles Extent, From An Actual Perambulation |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g8wAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA386 |volume=V |year=1808 |publisher=J Stratford |location=Holborn Hill, London |page=386 |chapter=Circuit of London}}</ref></blockquote>

==Death==
He died on 11 October 1721 at his home, (old) Cromwell House (demolished 1857), in Mortlake. In his will he wished to be buried simply without pomp, but this instruction was ignored. <ref> Edward Colston Will, National archives Wills Online </ref> His body was carried back to [[Bristol]] and was buried at [[All Saints, Bristol|All Saints' Church]]. His tomb was designed by [[James Gibbs]]. He died at the age of 84.<ref>{{NHLE |desc=Church of All Saints  |num=1282313 |accessdate=16 March 2003}}</ref>

==Modern reappraisal==
[[Image:Edward Colston 1895 statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Edward Colston in [[The Centre, Bristol]]]]
A statue, designed by [[John Cassidy (artist)|John Cassidy]], was erected in the centre of [[Bristol]] in 1895 to commemorate Colston's philanthropy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Edward Colston |work=PMSA National Recording Project |url=http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/BL/BR09.htm |accessdate=9 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109153705/http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/BL/BR09.htm |archivedate=9 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1998, however, "someone scrawled on its base the name of one of the professions in which he made his fortune: SLAVE TRADER." <ref>{{cite book|last=Hochschild|first=Adam|title=Bury the Chains|year=2006|publisher=Mariner Books|location=New York City|pages=15}}</ref> He is a divisive figure in Bristolian civil society, viewed by some as an inspirational figure for the city, due to his donations of money to schools and other causes, but, in more recent times as his activities as a major [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trader]] emerged,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Edward Colston [1636-1721 A.D.] A chronological account of his life and work.|last=Wilkins|first=H.

Some have called for his statue to be taken down. In a poll in the local newspaper, the ''[[Bristol Post]]'', in 2014 56 per cent of the 1,100 respondents said it should stay while 44 per cent wanted it to go.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bristol-torn-apart-over-statue-of-edward-colston-but-is-this-a-figure-of-shame-or-a-necessary-9555333.html|title=Bristol: Calls for statue of Edward Colston to be torn down|date=22 June 2014|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=16 November 2016}}</ref> Others called for a memorial plaque honouring the victims of [[Atlantic slave trade|slavery]] to be fitted to his statue. Bristol's first elected mayor, [[George Ferguson (architect)|George Ferguson]], stated on Twitter in 2013 that "Celebrations for Colston are perverse, not something I shall be taking part in!".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/bristol-mayor-city-s-celebration-edward-colston/story-19729958-detail/story.html|title=Bristol mayor: City's celebration of Edward Colston is|date=30 August 2013|newspaper=Bristol Post|access-date=16 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904091019/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-mayor-City-s-celebration-Edward-Colston/story-19729958-detail/story.html|archivedate=4 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In July 2018, [[Bristol City Council]], which is responsible for the statue, made a planning application to add a second plaque which would "add to the public knowledge about Colston", including his [[philanthropy]] and his involvement in slave trading.  

The initial wording of the second plaque focused on Colston's role in the slave trade, brief tenure as a Tory MP for Bristol, and criticised his philanthropy as religiously selective. Some local groups criticised the wording as "divisive"<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|last=Cork|first=Tristan|date=2018-07-22|title=The second plaque planned for Colston statue linking him to 20,000 deaths|work=bristolpost|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/wording-second-plaque-proposed-edward-1810137|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref> and a Bristol Conservative councillor called the wording "revisionist" and "historically illiterate."<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|last=Cork|first=Tristan|date=2018-07-23|title=Theft of second Colston plaque 'may be justified' says councillor|work=bristolpost|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/theft-vandalism-second-colston-statue-1815967|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref>

A second version, cowritten by an associate professor of history at the [[University of Bristol]], was proposed by the council in 2018, giving a brief description of Colston's philanthropy, role in the slave trade, and time as an MP, while noting he was now considered controversial. This wording was edited by a former curator at the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, creating a third proposal that was backed by the Bristol Civic Society.<ref name=":5">{{Cite news|last=Cork|first=Tristan|date=2018-08-23|title=Row breaks out over wording of Edward Colston statue plaque|work=bristolpost|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/row-breaks-out-merchant-venturer-1925896|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref> However, this wording was criticised by Dr Madge Dresser, the historian behind the second proposal, as a "sanitised" version of history, arguing the wording minimised Colston's role, omitted the number of child slaves, and focused on West Africans as the original enslavers. Reporting also noted the third version was written by a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers.<ref name=":5" />

A final version of wording with further changes was eventually agreed and a a bronze plaque was cast with wording as follows:

"Edward Colston (1636–1721), MP for Bristol (1710–1713), was one of this city’s greatest benefactors. He supported and endowed schools, almshouses, hospitals and churches in Bristol, London and elsewhere. Many of his charitable foundations continue. This statue was erected in 1895 to commemorate his philanthropy.

A significant proportion of Colston's wealth came from investments in slave trading, sugar and other slave-produced goods. As an official of the Royal African Company from 1680 to 1692, he was also involved in the transportation of approximately 84,000 enslaved African men, women and young children, of whom 19,000 died on voyages from West Africa to the Caribbean and the Americas."

However, after being cast, the installation of the plaque was vetoed in March 2019 by Mayor Marvin Rees, who criticised the role of the Merchant Venturers in creating the wording. A statement from the Mayor's office called the final wording "unacceptable" and claimed Rees had not been consulted, and promised to continue work on a second plaque.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Cork|first=Tristan|date=2019-03-25|title=Second Colston statue plaque not axed but mayor orders re-write|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/second-colston-statue-plaque-not-2682813|access-date=2019-03-30|website=bristolpost}}</ref>

On 7 June 2020, the statue of Colston in Bristol was pulled down during a [[Black Lives Matter]] demonstration, following the [[killing of George Floyd]] in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-06-07|title=Protesters begin fresh UK anti-racism demos|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52954305|access-date=2020-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-07|title=Black Lives Matter protesters pull down statue of 17th century UK slave trader|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/black-lives-matter-protests-uk-bristol-statue-edward-colston-slavery-a9553266.html|access-date=2020-06-07|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref>

Colston's name permeates the city in such landmarks as [[Colston Tower]], [[Colston Hall]], Colston Avenue, Colston Street, [[Colston's Girls' School]], [[Colston's School]], Colston's Primary School and Temple Colston School (now part of [[St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School|St Mary Redcliffe & Temple School]]). He is also remembered, particularly by some schools, charities and the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]], on Colston's Day on 13 November, his birthday, at a church service now at [[St Stephen's Church, Bristol|St Stephen's Church]]. A regional bread bun, the [[Colston bun]], is named after him.<ref name="ODNB" /><ref>{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Alan |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-211579-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00davi_0/page/114 114] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00davi_0/page/114 }}</ref>

In April 2017, the charity that runs the [[Colston Hall]], the [https://www.colstonhall.org/about-us/bristol-music-trust/ Bristol Music Trust], announced that it will drop the name of Colston when it reopens after refurbishment in 2020. There had been protests and petitions calling for a name change and some concertgoers and artists had [[boycott]]ed the venue because of the Colston name.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/26/bristol-colston-hall-to-drop-name-of-slave-trader-after-protests|title=Bristol's Colston Hall to drop name of slave trader after protests|date=26 April 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB}}</ref> Following the decision, petitions to retain the name of Colston reached almost 10,000 signatures, though the charity confirmed that the name change would go ahead.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/colston-hall-will-not-going-56636|title=Petitions to stop Colston Hall name change reach 9k signatures|last=Ballinger|first=Alex|date=2017-05-12|work=bristolpost|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref>
