Greene finished in first place in the primary election and faced John Cowan in the runoff election.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/calhoun_times/marjorie-greene-john-cowan-likely-headed-for-runoff-in-georgias-14th-congressional-district/article_fd3b400e-ab27-11ea-bc3e-d7ad0cb56b48.html |title=Marjorie Greene, John Cowan likely headed for runoff in Georgia's 14th Congressional District |newspaper=The Calhoun Times |agency=Capitol Beat News Service |first=Beau |last=Evans |date=June 10, 2020 |accessdate=June 13, 2020}}</ref> Greene defeated Cowan to win the nomination on August 11. Greene is considered an overwhelming favorite to win the seat in the general election, as the 14th typically votes heavily Republican.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/us/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-georgia-primary.html|title=Marjorie Taylor Greene, a QAnon Supporter, Wins House Primary in Georgia|first1=Matthew|last1=Rosenberg|first2=Astead W.|last2=Herndon|first3=Nick|last3=Corasaniti|date=August 11, 2020|access-date=August 13, 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref> The 14th has a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+27, making it the 10th most Republican district in the nation and the third most Republican district in the Eastern Time Zone. Among Georgia's congressional districts, only the neighboring [[Georgia's 9th congressional district|9th district]] is more Republican. [[Donald Trump]] carried the 14th with 75 percent of the vote in 2016, his eighth-best performance in the nation.<ref>[https://cookpolitical.com/pvi-map-and-district-list Cook Partisan Voting Index] for the 116th Congress</ref> On the day after Greene's runoff victory, Trump tweeted his support for her, describing Greene as a "future Republican Star" who "is strong on everything and never gives up â€” a real WINNER!"<ref>{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Max|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/12/trump-georgia-qanon-taylor-greene-394204|title=Trump calls Georgia GOP candidate who embraces QAnon a 'future Republican Star'|work=Politico|date=August 12, 2020|access-date=September 5, 2020}}</ref>

If she wins election, she will be the second Republican woman to represent Georgia in the House. The first, [[Karen Handel]], was elected to represent the 6th in a [[2017 Georgia's 6th congressional district special election|special election in 2017]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/21/politics/karen-handel-first-gop-woman-rep-congress-wins/index.html|title=Handel first female GOP rep elected to Congress in Georgia|author1=Sophie Tatum|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=June 21, 2017}}</ref> but was defeated for a full term in 2018. However, Greene would be the first Republican woman elected to a full term from a Georgia district.

Greene was initially expected to face Democratic IT specialist Kevin Van Audsal. However, on September 11, 2020; Van Audsal withdrew from the race. This left Greene unopposed for the general election, though the district is so heavily Republican that Van Audsal faced very long odds even if he had remained in the race.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/why-marjorie-taylor-greenes-opponent-quit-the-house-race/E3TYSMAAPRDUPPB6F3BBQAFCME/ |title=Why Marjorie Taylor Greene's opponent quit the House race |first1=Greg |last1=Bluestein |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |date=September 12, 2020}}</ref> Since the 14th's creation in 2012, no Democrat has won even 30 percent of the vote.



== Personal life ==
Greene and her husband, Perry, have owned Taylor Commercial, a construction company based in [[Alpharetta, Georgia]], since 2002.<ref>{{cite news |date=June 11, 2019 |title=Republican announces bid for Congress {{!}} News |url=http://www.thecrier.net/news/article_a10d7fe2-8c95-11e9-ab42-f73e656a5b68.html |accessdate=June 10, 2020 |newspaper=Dunwoody Crier}}</ref> She has long lived in Alpharetta, which is in the 6th District.
