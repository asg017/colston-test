==Career==
At age twenty-one, Bulbrook stopped playing the violin. She felt uneasy about her decision to quit, worrying that she would disappoint her family after years of lessons and providing an expensive, professional-grade violin for her. She then worked in [[public relations]]. While working as an intern at the magazine ''[[Filter (magazine)|Filter]]'', she played backing violin for a [[Kanye West]] performance in [[Aspen, Colorado]], which she described as a "revelation", as playing in that context was more casual and fun. [[Mikel Jollett]], who was an editor at ''Filter'', then invited her to tour with his band [[The Airborne Toxic Event]].<ref name="distinct"/>
