'''Kamala Devi Harris''' (born [[October 20]], [[1964]], in [[Oakland, California]]) is the current [[District Attorney]] of [[San Francisco]]. . She was elected in 2007 when she ran, unopposed, for District Attorney. She was also cited by the ''[[New York Times]]'' to be among the seventeen most likely women to become the first female [[President of the United States]].<ref name="Zernike2008">{{cite news |first=Kate |last=Zernike |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=She Just Might Be President Someday |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/weekinreview/18zernike.html |work=New York Times |publisher= |date=2008-05-18 |accessdate= }}</ref>

Harris attended the historically African American college, [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and received a [[Juris Doctor]] [[(J.D.)]] from [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]] in 1989.  She is the daughter of an [[Tamil people|Tamil Indian]] mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer specialist, who immigrated to the United States from [[Chennai, India]] in 1960, and a [[Jamaican American]] father, [[Stanford University]] economics professor Donald Harris. 

Harris served as Deputy District Attorney in [[Alameda County]], [[California]] from 1990 to 1998. She then became Managing Attorney of the Career Criminal Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office.  In 2000, San Francisco City Attorney [http://www.law.columbia.edu/media_inquiries/news_events/2003/aug_2003/renne_SF Louise Renne] recruited her to join the her office, where she was Chief of the Community and Neighborhood Division, which oversees civil [[code enforcement]] matters.{{Fact|date=September 2009}}  

In 2004, The [[National Urban League]] honored Harris as a "Woman of Power" and she received the Thurgood Marshall Award from the National Black Prosecutors Association in 2005.  The ''[[The Daily Journal Corporation|Los Angeles Daily Journal]]'' recognized Harris as one of the top 100 lawyers in California. Additionally, she has served on the boards of several community organizations.

In April 2004, when police officer Isaac Espinoza was gunned down in the Bayview district, Harris announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing, a decision which triggered protests from the police officers union, Sen. [[Diane Feinstein]], and many citizens.  Some{{Who?|date=September 2009}} were supportive of the decision in a community where [[capital punishment]] is opposed.  

Harris had made a campaign promise that she would not seek the death penalty if elected.  Attorney General [[Bill Lockyer]] even threatened to intervene on behalf of the State of California to take the case out of Harris' jurisdiction.  In the end, he ruled that Harris had acted within her legal authority.  

This stand was tested again in the case of [[Edwin Ramos]], an illegal immigrant and alleged MS13 gang-member who allegedly murdered Tony Bologna, 48, and his sons Michael, 20, and Matthew, 16 <ref name="latimes.com">[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-harris22-2009jun22,0,3668981,full.story ] LA Times, San Francisco D.A.'s program trained illegal immigrants for jobs they couldn't legally hold</ref>. The family was allegedldy gunned down by a gang member who had been arrested just a month earlier with a gun that had been used in a murder, but the DA's office had declined to press charges. On September 10, 2009 Harris announced she would seek "life in prison without the possibility of parole," rather than the death penalty in the Ramos case. <ref name="The San Francisco Chronicle">[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/11/BAM819L7NE.DTL ] San Francisco Chronicle, Edwin Ramos won't face death penalty</ref>. There is currently a lawsuit by the family against the city of San Francisco that claims the city contributed to the deaths of Danielle Bolognaâ€™s husband, Anthony Bologna, and two of their sons, through its sanctuary city policy. A judge has recently ruled that the family can sue San Francisco in state court. <ref name="The San Francisco Examiner">[http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Bologna-family-lawsuit-returned-to-superior-court-59288117.html ]

Ms. Harris, whom critics often label as "soft on crime," has also come under fire for a drug-diversion program ("Back on Track") which accepted illegal alien felons for job-training when such persons could not legally hold jobs in the United States.  This came to light when one program client, Alexander Izaguirre, allegedly grabbed a woman's purse then attempted to run her over in the process of his getaway.<ref name="latimes.com"/> 

Harris ran unopposed for re-election in 2007. She has received acclaim from some for increasing conviction rates over previous DA, [[Terence Hallinan]] (whose conviction rate was 52% versus the 83% state-wide average), but has been widely criticized for selectively prosecuting cases to bolster the conviction rate, which now stands at about 67%. However, San Francisco still has the lowest incarceration rate in the state of California. Harris has also faced criticism in the face of continuing poor relations with police and rising violent crime rates. <ref>[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/03/20/MNG01HQVPA1.DTL Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A.]</ref>

Harris is a candidate for [[Attorney General of California]] in 2010.
