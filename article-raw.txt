She was first elected in 2003, defeating incumbent district attorney [[Terence Hallinan]]. She was re-elected in 2007. She was also cited by the ''[[New York Times]]'' to be among the seventeen most likely women to become the first female [[President of the United States]].<ref name="Zernike2008">{{cite news |first=Kate |last=Zernike |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=She Just Might Be President Someday |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/weekinreview/18zernike.html |work=New York Times |publisher= |date=2008-05-18 |accessdate= }}</ref>  She is currently a candidate for [[California Attorney General]]<ref>http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-11-12/news/17125849_1_harris-democrat-barack-obama-political-front D.A. Harris plans run for attorney general</ref>. If elected, she would be the first woman and first person of color elected Attorney General of California.
==Early life and education==
Harris attended the historically African American college, [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and received a [[Juris Doctor]] [[(J.D.)]] from [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]] in 1989.  She is the daughter of an [[Tamil people|Tamil Indian]] mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer specialist, who immigrated to the United States from [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] in 1960, and a [[Jamaican American]] father, [[Stanford University]] economics professor Donald Harris. 
==Career==
Harris served as Deputy District Attorney in [[Alameda County]], [[California]] from 1990 to 1998. She then became Managing Attorney of the Career Criminal Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office.  In 2000, San Francisco City Attorney [http://www.law.columbia.edu/media_inquiries/news_events/2003/aug_2003/renne_SF Louise Renne] recruited her to join the her office, where she was Chief of the Community and Neighborhood Division, which oversees civil [[code enforcement]] matters.<ref>[http://www.womensradio.com/articles/This-DA-Makes-a-Difference-for-Women/559.html Women's Radio: This DA Makes a Difference For Women]</ref> The ''[[The Daily Journal Corporation|Los Angeles Daily Journal]]'' recognized Harris as one of the top 100 lawyers in California. Additionally, she has served on the boards of several community organizations.

Harris ran unopposed for re-election in 2007. She has received acclaim from some for increasing conviction rates over previous DA, [[Terence Hallinan]] (whose conviction rate was 52% versus the 83% state-wide average). However, San Francisco still has the lowest incarceration rate in the state of California. She has been called a front-runner in her campaign for [[Attorney General of California]] in 2010.<ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24604_Page3.html Politico: Ones to Watch Outside of the Beltway]</ref>

Harris is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)| Democratic Party]].

====Death penalty====
Harris is personally opposed to the death penalty, but has said that she would review each case individually.<ref name="sfbg.com">[http://www.sfbg.com/blogs/politics/2009/09/give_kamala_harris_credit_for.html San Francisco Bay Guardian - Give Kamala Harris Credit for Intregrity]</ref> However, her position was tested in April 2004, when police officer Isaac Espinoza was murdered in the Bayview district. Harris announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing. While the decision sparked protests from the police officers union, Sen. [[Diane Feinstein]], and others, many in San Francisco supported the decision.  Those who supported the decision included actor [[Mike Farrell]], San Francisco Supervisors [[Tom Ammiano]] and [[Sophie Maxwell]], in whose Bayview district the murder occurred.<ref>[http://www.basetree.com/photos/sets/photography39.html BASETREE - Don't Kill in Our Name, Rally to Support Kamala Harris]</ref>  

Harris' position against the death penalty was tested again in the case of [[Edwin Ramos]], an undocumented immigrant and alleged MS13 gang-member who allegedly murdered Tony Bologna, 48, and his sons Michael, 20, and Matthew, 16 <ref name="latimes.com">[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-harris22-2009jun22,0,3668981,full.story ] LA Times, San Francisco D.A.'s program trained illegal immigrants for jobs they couldn't legally hold</ref>. The family was allegedly murdered by Ramos, who had been arrested just a month earlier with a gun that had been used in a murder, but the DA's office had declined to press charges. On September 10, 2009 Harris announced she would seek "life in prison without the possibility of parole," rather than the death penalty in the Ramos case. <ref name="The San Francisco Chronicle">[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/11/BAM819L7NE.DTL ] San Francisco Chronicle, Edwin Ramos won't face death penalty</ref>. There is currently a lawsuit by the family against the city of San Francisco that claims the city contributed to the deaths of Danielle Bolognaâ€™s husband, Anthony Bologna, and two of their sons, through its sanctuary city policy. A judge has recently ruled that the family can sue San Francisco in state court.  <ref name="The San Francisco Examiner">[http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Bologna-family-lawsuit-returned-to-superior-court-59288117.html ]</ref>

====Violent crimes and felons====
As San Francisco District Attorney, Harris has taken a hard-line stance against perpetrators of violent crimes and felons. She raised the overall felony conviction rate from 52% in 2003 to 67% in 2006, the highest in a decade, secured an 85% conviction rate for homicides, and increased convictions of drug dealers from 56% in 2003 to 74% in 2006.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/34 "Convicting Felons"]</ref> While police have credited Harris with tightening loopholes in bail and drug programs that defendants exploite, they have accused her of being slow to prosecute murder suspects.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/03/20/MNG01HQVPA1.DTL#ixzz0jKyN3hF9 "Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A."]</ref> She has prosecuted gun crimes and gang violence with much success. She increased the number of gun cases taken to trial and doubled the conviction rate in felony gun trials, from 43% in 2003 to 90% in 2006 and has put 216 gang members behind bars.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/107 "Guns and Gang Violence"]</ref>

Harris has also taken a hard-line stance against perpetrators of gender-based violence, human trafficking, sex offenses, child assault, and domestic violence. She co-Sponsored the California Trafficking Victims Protection Act, created a Child Assault Unit in the District Attorney's Office,  raised the conviction rate in domestic violence trials, increased prison time for sex offenses against children, and led the creation efforts for San Francisco's first Safe House for sexually exploited youth.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/111 "Child Assault and Domestic Violence"]</ref><ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/110 "Human Trafficking and Sex Offenses"]</ref>

In 2009, Harris wrote Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor's Plan to Make Us Safer.<ref>[http://blogcritics.org/books/article/book-review-smart-on-crime-by1/ Book Review of Smart on Crime]</ref>.  She has been outspoken on the need for innovation in public safety. While some challenge her programs as "soft on crime," the programs are designed to reduce the recidivism rate in San Francisco.<ref>[http://www.sfdistrictattorney.org/page.asp?id=49 San Francisco District Attorney - Reentry]</ref> One such program, "Back on Track" was signed into law by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as a model program for the state.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kamala-d-harris/finding-the-path-back-on_b_350679.html Huffington Post: Kamala Harris: Finding the Path Back on Track]</ref> While there have been some issues with removing undocumented immigrants from the program,<ref name="latimes.com"/> it has since been revised to address this concern.

====Civil rights====
Harris has long been concerned with civil rights issues, creating a special Hate Crimes Unit as San Francisco District Attorney. She is especially concerned with hate crimes against LGBT children and teens in schools. She convened a national conference to confront the "gay-transgender panic defense," which has been used to justify violent hate crimes.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/113 "Hate Crimes and Protecting Victims"]</ref> Harris supports same-sex marriage in California, opposing both [[Proposition 22]] and [[Proposition 8]].<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/MarriageEquality "Marriage Equality"]</ref>

Harris has also had  along history supporting civil rights for people of color and women. In 2004, The [[National Urban League]] honored Harris as a "Woman of Power" and she received the Thurgood Marshall Award from the National Black Prosecutors Association in 2005. In her campaign for California Attorney General, she has received the endorsements of numerous community groups, including [[EMILY's List]], California Legislative Black Caucus, Asian American Action Fund, Black Women Organized for Political Action, Mexican American Bar Association, South Asians for Opportunity, and the National Women's Political Caucus.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/endorsements "Endorsements"]</ref>

====Education====
In interviews with [[Matt Lauer]] on the [[Today Show]] and local [[KGO-TV]], Harris argued for treating "habitually and chronic truancy" among children in elementary school as a crime committed by the parents of truant children. She argues that there is a direct connection between habitual truancy in elementary school and crime later in life.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i0tpAqrDDY "KGO/ABC 7's View from the Bay's Interview with Kamala Harris on Truancy Rates"]</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-c-4FlgUT0 "Kamala Harris on the Today Show"]</ref> She has received the endorsement of the California Federation of Teachers.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/endorsements "Endorsements"]</ref>

====Labor rights====
In her campaign for California Attorney General, Harris has received the endorsements of United Farm Workers Co-Founder [[Dolores Huerta]], United Educators of San Francisco, and the San Francisco Firefighters Local 798.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/endorsements "Endorsements"]</ref>

====Environment====
During her time as San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created the Environmental Justice Unit in the San Francisco District Attorneyâ€™s Office and has prosecuted several industries and individuals for pollution, most notably [[U-Haul]], Alameda Publishing Corporation, and the [[Cosco Busan oil spill]]. She has also advocated for strong enforcement of environmental protection laws. <ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/613 "Protecting the Environment"]</ref>

====Financial crimes====
Harris has prosecuted numerous financial crimes throughout her career, particularly those affecting elders, high-tech crime, and identity theft.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/594 "Prosecuting Financial Crimes"]</ref>
