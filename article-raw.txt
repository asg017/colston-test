'''Edward Colston''' (2 November 1636 – 11 October 1721) was an English merchant, philanthropist,{{Disputed inline|Request for comment on opening paragraph|date=June 2020}} and [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] Member of Parliament who was involved in the [[Atlantic slave trade]].

Colston followed his father in the family business becoming a sea merchant, initially trading in wine, fruits and textiles, mainly in Spain, Portugal and other European ports. By 1680, he became involved in the slave trade as a member of the [[Royal African Company]], which held a monopoly on the English trade in African slaves. He was deputy governor of the company in 1689–90.<ref name=EC_morgan /><ref name=hayton/><ref name="dresser">{{cite journal |last=Dresser |first=Madge |year=2000 |title=Squares of distinction, webs of interest: Gentility, urban development and the slave trade in Bristol c.1673–1820 |journal=Slavery & Abolition a Journal of Slave and Post-Slave Studies |publisher=Routledge |volume=21 |issue=3 |page=22 |issn=1743-9523 |doi=10.1080/01440390008575319 |url=http://ejscontent.ebsco.com/ContentServer.aspx?target=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.informaworld.com%2Fsmpp%2Fftinterface%3Fcontent%3Da794052444%26format%3Dpdf%26magic%3Debscohostejs |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710170556/http://ejscontent.ebsco.com/ContentServer.aspx?target=http:%2F%2Fwww.informaworld.com%2Fsmpp%2Fftinterface%3Fcontent=a794052444&format=pdf&magic=ebscohostejs |archivedate=10 July 2011|quote=Some subsequent scholars have preferred to stress [...] his other commercial involvements -- in fruit and wines and cloth, and in West Indian sugar.

Colston's name was widely commemorated in Bristol landmarks, and a [[Statue of Edward Colston|statue of him]] was erected in 1895. With growing awareness in the late 20th century of his involvement in [[Slavery_in_Britain#Enslaved_Africans|Britain's slave trade]], there were protests and petitions for name changes, culminating in June 2020, when the statue was toppled and dumped in [[Bristol Harbour]] by [[Black Lives Matter]] protestors.

==Early life==
Colston was born on 2 November 1636 in Temple Street,<ref name=ODNB_morgan/> [[Bristol]], and baptised in the [[Temple Church, Bristol]]. His parents were William Colston (1608–1681), a prosperous Royalist merchant who was [[High Sheriff of Bristol]] in 1643, and his wife Sarah Batten (d.1701), daughter of Edward Batten; he was the eldest of at least 11 and possibly as many as 15 children. The Colston family had lived in the city since the late 13th century.<ref name=hayton>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/colston-edward-ii-1636-1721 |title=Colston, Edward II (1636-1721), of Mortlake, Surr.|website=The History of Parliament |author-first=Andrew A. |author-last=Hanham|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] / Institute of Historical Research|editor-last=Hayton |editor-first=David |editor-last2=Cruickshanks |editor-first2=Eveline |editor-last3=Handley |editor-first3=Stuart |date=April 2006 |accessdate=13 June 2020|quote=From 1680 he became heavily involved in the slave trade, from which he made the bulk of his fortune, and was an active member of the Royal African Company, becoming deputy-governor briefly during 1689–90.}}</ref> Colston was brought up in Bristol until the time of the [[English Civil War]], when he probably lived for a while on his father's estate in [[Winterbourne, South Gloucestershire|Winterbourne]], just north of the city.

==Career==
In 1654 Colston was apprenticed to the [[Mercers Company]] for eight years, and in 1673 he was enrolled into it.<ref name=ODNB_morgan /> By 1672 he had become a merchant in London.<ref name=hayton/> Like his father Colston exported in textiles from London while importing oils, wine and sherry from Spain and Portugal. He also traded silk with Virginia and was a regular trader of [[Newfoundland]] [[cod]] to Naples.<ref name=EC_morgan /> He had built up a successful business trading with Spain, Portugal, Italy and Africa.<ref name=ODNB_morgan /> 

In 1680, Colston became a member of the [[Royal African Company]], which had held the monopoly in [[Kingdom of England|England]] on trading along the [[West Africa|west coast of Africa]] in gold, silver, [[ivory]] and [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]] from 1662.<ref name=ODNB_morgan /> Colston was deputy governor of the company from 1689 to 1690. His association with the company ended in 1692.<ref name=hayton/> This company had been set up by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and his brother the [[James II of England|Duke of York (later King James II)]], who was the governor of the company, together with [[City of London]] merchants, and it had many notable investors, including philosopher and physician [[John Locke]] (who later changed his stance on the slave trade) and the diarist [[Samuel Pepys]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bl.uk/restoration-18th-century-literature/articles/britains-involvement-with-new-world-slavery-and-the-transatlantic-slave-trade |title=Britain's involvement with New World slavery and the transatlantic slave trade |website=The British Library |access-date=18 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The sugar barons: family, corruption, empire, and war in the West Indies |last=Matthew |first=Parker |date=2011 |publisher=Walker & Co |isbn=9780802717443 |location=New York |pages=126 |oclc=682894539}}</ref>

During Colston's involvement with the Royal African Company from 1680 to 1692 it is estimated that the company transported over 84,000 African men, women and children to the [[Caribbean]] and the rest of the Americas, of whom as many as 19,000 may have died on the journey.<ref name=CorkSecondPlaqueRow>{{cite web

}}</ref> The slaves were sold for labour on [[Plantation economy|tobacco]], and, increasingly, [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantations]], whose planters considered Africans would be more suited to the conditions than British workers, as the climate resembled the climate of their homeland in West Africa. Enslaved Africans were much less expensive to maintain than [[indentured servants]] or paid [[wage labour]]ers from Britain.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/archaeology/caribbean/ |title=Slavery in the Caribbean – International Slavery Museum, Liverpool museums |website=liverpoolmuseums.org.uk |access-date=19 November 2018}}</ref>

Colston's parents had resettled in Bristol. In 1682 he made a loan to the [[Bristol Corporation]] and the following year, became a member of the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Latimer|first=John|url=http://archive.org/details/historyofsociety00latiuoft|title=The history of the Society of Merchant Venturers of the City of Bristol; with some account of the anterior Merchants' Guilds|date=1903|publisher=Bristol, Arrowsmith|others=Robarts - University of Toronto}}</ref>

Although a [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] [[High church|High Churchman]] and often in conflict with the Whig corporation of Bristol, Colston transferred a large segment of his original shareholding to [[William III of England|William III]] at the beginning of 1689, securing the new regime's favour for the African Co. The value of Colston's shares increased and being without heirs he began to donate large sums to charities. He withdrew from the African Co. in 1692, but continued trading in slaves privately. He retired in 1708. Colston was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] for [[Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol]] (1710-13).<ref>{{cite book |last=Gardiner |first=Juliet |author-link=Juliet Gardiner |date=2000 |title=The History Today Who's Who In British History |location=London |publisher=Collins & Brown Limited and Cima Books |page=192 |isbn=1-85585-876-2}}</ref>

==Death==
[[File:CromwellHouseMortlake.jpg|thumb|right|Cromwell House, [[Mortlake]], where Colston died in 1721]]
Colston died on 11 October 1721, aged 84, at his home, (old) Cromwell House (demolished 1857), in [[Mortlake]], south west London. His will stated that he wished to be buried simply without pomp, but this instruction was ignored.<ref> Edward Colston Will, National archives Wills Online</ref> His body was carried to Bristol and was buried at [[All Saints' Church, Bristol|All Saints' Church]]. His monument was designed by [[James Gibbs]] with an effigy carved by [[John Michael Rysbrack]].<ref>{{NHLE |desc=Church of All Saints  |num=1282313 |accessdate=16 March 2003}}</ref>

Colston never married, and settled a "considerable fortune in land" on his nephew [[Edward Colston (MP for Wells)]], when Edward married in 1704.<ref>{{Cite web|title=COLSTON, Edward I (aft.1672-1719), of Bristol {{!}} History of Parliament Online|url=https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/colston-edward-i-1672-1719|access-date=2020-06-22|website=www.historyofparliamentonline.org}}</ref>

===Modern reappraisal===
Since at least the 1990s, with increasing recognition of Colston's role in the slave trade, there has been growing criticism of his commemoration.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/032fe4a0-9a96-11e8-ab77-f854c65a4465 |title=Bristol, the slave trade and a reckoning with the past |work=Financial Times |first=Judith |last=Evans |date=9 August 2018 |accessdate=3 July 2020}}</ref>  The Dolphin Society, which was formed to continue Colston's philanthropy, now refers to 'the evils of slavery' and recognises that 'black citizens in Bristol today can suffer disadvantage in terms of education, employment and housing for reasons that connect back to the days of the trans-Atlantic slave trade'.<ref name=ColstonDolphin />

The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' states that Colston made much of his fortune from the buying and selling of slaves.<ref name=ODNB_morgan /> The proportion of his wealth that came from his involvement in the slave trade and slave-produced sugar is unknown, and can only be the subject of conjecture. He also made money from trading in other commodities mentioned above and interest from [[money lending]].<ref name=EC_morgan>{{cite book |title=Edward Colston and Bristol |last=Morgan |first=Kenneth |publisher=Bristol Branch of the Historical Association |year=1999 |isbn= |location=Bristol |pages=3 |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/bristolrecordsociety/publications/bha096.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200608093149/http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/bristolrecordsociety/publications/bha096.pdf |archive-date=8 June 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>
