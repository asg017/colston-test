'''Kamala Devi Harris''' (born October 20, 1964, in [[Oakland, California]]) is the current [[District Attorney]] of [[San Francisco]]. She was first elected in 2003, defeating incumbent district attorney [[Terence Hallinan]]. She was re-elected in 2007.  She is currently a candidate for [[California Attorney General]] in the [[California Attorney General election, 2010|2010 California State Elections]]<ref>http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-11-12/news/17125849_1_harris-democrat-barack-obama-political-front D.A. Harris plans run for attorney general</ref>. If elected, she would be the first woman and first person of color elected Attorney General of California.
==Early life and education==
Harris attended the historically African American college, [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and received a [[Juris Doctor]] [[(J.D.)]] from [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]] in 1989.  She is the daughter of an [[Tamil people|Tamil Indian]] mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer specialist, who immigrated to the United States from [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] in 1960, and a [[Jamaican American]] father, [[Stanford University]] economics professor Donald Harris.
==Career==
Harris served as Deputy District Attorney in [[Alameda County]], [[California]] from 1990 to 1998. She then became Managing Attorney of the Career Criminal Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office.  In 2000, San Francisco City Attorney [http://www.law.columbia.edu/media_inquiries/news_events/2003/aug_2003/renne_SF Louise Renne] recruited her to join her office, where she was Chief of the Community and Neighborhood Division, which oversees civil [[code enforcement]] matters.<ref>[http://www.womensradio.com/articles/This-DA-Makes-a-Difference-for-Women/559.html Women's Radio: This DA Makes a Difference For Women]</ref> The ''[[The Daily Journal Corporation|Los Angeles Daily Journal]]'' recognized Harris as one of the top 100 lawyers in California. Additionally, she has served on the boards of several community organizations.

Harris ran unopposed for re-election in 2007. She has received acclaim from some for increasing conviction rates over previous DA, [[Terence Hallinan]] (whose conviction rate was 52% versus the 83% state-wide average). She has been called a front-runner in her campaign for [[Attorney General of California]] in 2010.<ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24604_Page3.html Politico: Ones to Watch Outside of the Beltway]</ref>

====Death penalty====
Harris is personally opposed to the death penalty, but has said that she would review each case individually.<ref name="sfbg.com">[http://www.sfbg.com/blogs/politics/2009/09/give_kamala_harris_credit_for.html San Francisco Bay Guardian - Give Kamala Harris Credit for Intregrity]</ref> Her position was tested in April 2004, when police officer Isaac Espinoza was murdered in the Bayview district. Harris announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing. While the decision sparked protests from the police officers union, Sen. [[Diane Feinstein]], and others, many in San Francisco supported the decision.  Those who supported the decision included actor [[Mike Farrell]], San Francisco Supervisors [[Tom Ammiano]] and [[Sophie Maxwell]], in whose Bayview district the murder occurred.<ref>[http://www.basetree.com/photos/sets/photography39.html BASETREE - Don't Kill in Our Name, Rally to Support Kamala Harris]</ref>

Harris' position against the death penalty was tested again in the case of [[Edwin Ramos]], an undocumented immigrant and alleged [[MS-13]] gang member who allegedly murdered Tony Bologna, and his sons Michael and Matthew.<ref name="latimes.com">[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-harris22-2009jun22,0,3668981,full.story ] LA Times, San Francisco D.A.'s program trained illegal immigrants for jobs they couldn't legally hold</ref>. Ramos was arrested just a month earlier with a gun that had been used in a murder, but the DA's office had declined to press charges. On September 10, 2009 Harris announced she would seek "life in prison without the possibility of parole," rather than the death penalty in the Ramos case.<ref name="The San Francisco Chronicle">[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/11/BAM819L7NE.DTL ] San Francisco Chronicle, Edwin Ramos won't face death penalty</ref>. There is currently a lawsuit by the family against the city of San Francisco that claims the city contributed to the deaths of Danielle Bologna’s husband, Anthony Bologna, and two of their sons, through its sanctuary city policy. A judge has recently ruled that the family can sue San Francisco in state court.<ref name="The San Francisco Examiner">[http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Bologna-family-lawsuit-returned-to-superior-court-59288117.html ]</ref>

====Violent crimes and felons====
As San Francisco District Attorney, Harris has had much success prosecuting violent crimes and felonies. She raised the overall felony conviction rate from 52% in 2003 to 67% in 2006, the highest in a decade, secured an 85% conviction rate for homicides, and increased convictions of drug dealers from 56% in 2003 to 74% in 2006.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/34 "Convicting Felons"]</ref> While police have credited Harris with tightening loopholes in bail and drug programs that defendants exploit, they have accused her of being slow to prosecute murder suspects.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/03/20/MNG01HQVPA1.DTL#ixzz0jKyN3hF9 "Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A."]</ref> She has prosecuted gun crimes and gang violence with much success. She increased the number of gun cases taken to trial and doubled the conviction rate in felony gun trials, from 43% in 2003 to 90% in 2006 and has put 216 gang members behind bars.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/107 "Guns and Gang Violence"]</ref>

A report by the SF Weekly revealed that the performance of prosecutors in Harris’ district attorney's office is less impressive than suggested by her conviction statistics. The records show that while Harris' overall conviction rate has reached new highs over the past several years, that success is based almost entirely on plea deals negotiated before defendants accused of serious crimes proceed to trial. Felony convictions for cases that actually go to trial and reach a jury verdict — a comparatively small group that nevertheless includes some of a district attorney's most violent and emotionally charged cases — have declined significantly over the past two years.<ref name="sfweekly.com">http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-05-05/news/a-lack-of-conviction/</ref>

The result is a justice system that looks healthy by certain statistical measures, but fails to mete out justice for the city's worst crimes on a surprisingly regular basis.<ref name="sfweekly.com"/>

Harris has also taken a hard-line stance against perpetrators of gender-based violence, human trafficking, sex offenses, child assault, and domestic violence. She co-Sponsored the California Trafficking Victims Protection Act, created a Child Assault Unit in the District Attorney's Office,  raised the conviction rate in domestic violence trials, increased prison time for sex offenses against children, and led the creation efforts for San Francisco's first Safe House for sexually exploited youth.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/111 "Child Assault and Domestic Violence"]</ref><ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/110 "Human Trafficking and Sex Offenses"]</ref>

In 2009, Harris wrote ''Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor's Plan to Make Us Safer''.<ref>[http://blogcritics.org/books/article/book-review-smart-on-crime-by1/ Book Review of Smart on Crime]</ref>.  She has been outspoken on the need for innovation in public safety. While some challenge her programs as "soft on crime," the programs are designed to reduce the recidivism rate in San Francisco.<ref>[http://www.sfdistrictattorney.org/page.asp?id=49 San Francisco District Attorney - Reentry]</ref> One such program, "Back on Track" was signed into law by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as a model program for the state.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kamala-d-harris/finding-the-path-back-on_b_350679.html Huffington Post: Kamala Harris: Finding the Path Back on Track]</ref> While there have been some issues with removing undocumented immigrants from the program,<ref name="latimes.com"/> it has since been revised to address this concern.

====Jeopardized Convictions====
On May 4, 2010, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that “hundreds of felony convictions” were in jeopardy when it was revealed that the Harris' district attorney’s office did not disclose criminal backgrounds for over 80 San Francisco police officers before testifying. “Under the law, prosecutors [with the District Attorney’s office] are responsible for alerting defense attorneys when any witness, including a police officer, has been arrested or convicted for a broad range of crimes, or accused of misconduct for such disciplinary offenses as lying during internal affairs interviews.”<ref name="articles.sfgate.com">http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-05-04/news/20883129_1_police-officers-cocaine-cases-police-disciplinary-cases</ref>

According to San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi, it is the district attorney's job to check the criminal history of every witness. The potential fallout could be far more severe than that caused by the cocaine-skimming scandal at the San Francisco police drug lab, which prompted prosecutors to dismiss more than 600 narcotics cases, experts say.” <ref name="articles.sfgate.com"/>

====Drug-Lab Scandal====
San Francisco Police Department drug lab technician Deborah Madden admitted to taking amounts of cocaine from evidence samples in the city's crime lab. The testing unit of the lab was shut down on March 9, 2010. Since then, hundreds of drug cases have either been dismissed or discharged.

Harris' district attorney’s office was aware of problems at the drug lab — including issues with Madden — months before it was revealed to the public. "The situation at the crime lab is becoming ridiculous,” Assistant District Attorney Sharon Woo wrote in a November letter to Russ Giuntini, the second-highest-ranking attorney, and Jeffrey Ross, head of the criminal division in District Attorney Kamala Harris’ office. According to Harris' district attorney’s office, the letter "only shows that Madden was calling in sick and that she was so erratic in her attendance that she compromised cases.”<ref>http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/SFPD-drug-lab-technician-issues-not-addressed-90907184.html#ixzz0nkuMJLsz</ref>

Police widened the investigation after The San Francisco Chronicle reported that there were discrepancies in evidence as far back as 2005 - raising questions about whether already-won convictions could be at risk.<ref>http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-04-03/news/20833423_1_drug-lab-crime-lab-drug-cases</ref>

====Civil rights====
Harris has long been concerned with civil rights issues, creating a special Hate Crimes Unit as San Francisco District Attorney. She is especially concerned with hate crimes against LGBT children and teens in schools. She convened a national conference to confront the "gay-transgender panic defense," which has been used to justify violent hate crimes.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/113 "Hate Crimes and Protecting Victims"]</ref> Harris supports same-sex marriage in California and opposed both [[Proposition 22]] and [[Proposition 8]].<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/MarriageEquality "Marriage Equality"]</ref>

Harris has also had  a long history supporting civil rights for people of color and women. In 2004, The [[National Urban League]] honored Harris as a "Woman of Power" and she received the [[Thurgood_Marshall#Thurgood_Marshall_Award|Thurgood Marshall Award]] from the National Black Prosecutors Association in 2005. In her campaign for California Attorney General, she has received the endorsements of numerous community groups, including [[EMILY's List]], California Legislative Black Caucus, Asian American Action Fund, Black Women Organized for Political Action, Mexican American Bar Association, South Asians for Opportunity, and the National Women's Political Caucus.<ref name="Endorsements">[http://kamalaharris.org/endorsements "Endorsements"]</ref>

====Education====
In interviews with [[Matt Lauer]] on the [[Today Show]] and local [[KGO-TV]], Harris argued for treating "habitually and chronic truancy" among children in elementary school as a crime committed by the parents of truant children. She argues that there is a direct connection between habitual truancy in elementary school and crime later in life.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i0tpAqrDDY "KGO/ABC 7's View from the Bay's Interview with Kamala Harris on Truancy Rates"]</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-c-4FlgUT0 "Kamala Harris on the Today Show"]</ref> She has received the endorsement of the California Federation of Teachers.<ref name="Endorsements"/>

====Labor rights====
In her campaign for California Attorney General, Harris has received the endorsements of United Farm Workers Co-Founder [[Dolores Huerta]], United Educators of San Francisco, and the San Francisco Firefighters Local 798.<ref name="Endorsements"/>

====Environment====
During her time as San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created the Environmental Justice Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office and has prosecuted several industries and individuals for pollution, most notably [[U-Haul]], Alameda Publishing Corporation, and the [[Cosco Busan oil spill]]. She has also advocated for strong enforcement of environmental protection laws.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/613 "Protecting the Environment"]</ref>

====Financial Crimes and Prosecutorial Misconduct ====
Harris has prosecuted numerous financial crimes throughout her career, particularly those affecting elders, high-tech crime, and identity theft.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/594 "Prosecuting Financial Crimes"]</ref>

On May 19, 2010, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo ruled that 
San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris' office violated defendants' rights by hiding damaging information about a police drug lab technician and was indifferent to demands that it account for its failings. According to the San Francisco ''Chronicle'', Judge Massullo stopped short of granting a request by more than 40 drug defendants that their cases be dismissed because of prosecutorial misconduct, saying that decision must be left up to the judges hearing their cases. 

But in a scathing ruling, the judge concluded that prosecutors had failed to fulfill their constitutional duty to tell defense attorneys about problems surrounding Deborah Madden, the now-retired technician at the heart of a cocaine-skimming scandal that led San Francisco police to shut down the drug analysis section of their crime lab. Prosecutors, unable to vouch for the reliability of Madden's work, have dismissed more than 600 drug cases since the scandal became public in February. Madden testified at trials before leaving the lab in December. Under a 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, district attorneys are obligated to hand over to the defense information about prosecution witnesses that could be used to challenge their credibility.

The failure by Harris' office "to produce information actually in its possession regarding Madden and the crime lab is a violation of the defendants' constitutional rights," Massullo wrote. 
She said Harris' office had the "duty to implement some type of procedure to secure and produce information relevant to Madden's criminal history." But Massullo said her repeated requests that prosecutors explain why they did not have such procedures were met with "a level of indifference."
