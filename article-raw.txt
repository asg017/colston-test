'''Kamala Devi Harris''' (born October 20, 1964) is an American attorney, author, politician, and the current [[District Attorney]] of [[San Francisco]]. She was first elected in 2003, defeating incumbent district attorney [[Terence Hallinan]], and was re-elected in 2007.  In the 2010 election cycle, she was a candidate for [[California Attorney General]] in the [[California Attorney General election, 2010|2010 California state elections]]<ref>Marinucci, Carla.

==Early life and education==
Harris was born in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]]. She is the daughter of a [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[India]]n mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer specialist, who immigrated to the United States from [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], India in 1960, and a [[Jamaican American]] father, [[Stanford University]] economics professor Donald Harris.

Harris attended [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where she was initiated into [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] sorority, and received a [[Juris Doctor]] (JD) from [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]] in 1989.

==Career==
Harris served as Deputy District Attorney in [[Alameda County, California]] from 1990 to 1998. She then became Managing Attorney of the Career Criminal Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office.  In 2000, San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne recruited Harris to join her office, where she was Chief of the Community and Neighborhood Division, which oversees civil [[code enforcement]] matters.<ref>[http://www.womensradio.com/articles/This-DA-Makes-a-Difference-for-Women/559.html Women's Radio: This DA Makes a Difference For Women]</ref> The ''[[The Daily Journal Corporation|Los Angeles Daily Journal]]'' recognized Harris as one of the top 100 lawyers in California. Harris serves on the board of the California District Attorney's Association and is Vice President of the National District Attorneys Association.<ref name="nomination">{{cite news|title=Kamla Harris wins Dem nomination for California AG|url=http://www.zeenews.com/news632777.html|accessdate=August 19, 2010|newspaper=Z News|date=June 9, 2010}}</ref>

Harris ran unopposed for re-election in 2007. She was called a front-runner in her campaign being nominated to be [[Attorney General of California]] in 2010,<ref>{{cite news|title=Ones to watch outside the Beltway|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24604_Page3.html|accessdate=August 21, 2010|newspaper=[[Politico (newspaper){{!}}Politico]]|date=July 9, 2009}}</ref> and on June 8, 2010, she received the Democratic nomination for California Attorney General.<ref>{{cite news|title=Newsom And Harris Wins Democratic Nods For Lt Gov, State AG|url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/23840282/detail.html|accessdate=August 21, 2010|newspaper=KTVU|date=June 8, 2010}}</ref> 

In 2009, Harris wrote ''Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor's Plan to Make Us Safer.''<ref>[http://blogcritics.org/books/article/book-review-smart-on-crime-by1/ Book Review of Smart on Crime]</ref> Harris looks at criminal justice from an economic perspective, attempting to reduce temptation and access for criminals.<ref name="HPQA">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kimberly-marteau-emerson/san-francisco-da-kamala-h_b_369505.html Huffington Post: Kimberly Marteau Emerson: Smart on Crime Q&A]</ref> The book goes through a series of "myths" surrounding the criminal justice system, and presents proposals to reduce and prevent crime.<ref name="HPQA" />

She has been outspoken on the need for innovation in public safety, particularly with respect to reducing the [[recidivism]] rate in San Francisco.<ref>[http://www.sfdistrictattorney.org/page.asp?id=49 San Francisco District Attorney - Reentry]</ref> One such program, "Back on Track" was signed into law by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as a model program for the state.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kamala-d-harris/finding-the-path-back-on_b_350679.html Huffington Post: Kamala Harris: Finding the Path Back on Track]</ref> Initially, there were issues with removing illegal immigrants from the program, including an incident involving Alexander Izaguirre, who was later arrested for assault.<ref name="latimes.com" />  However, before the program was named a state model by Governor Schwarzenegger,<ref>[http://www.sfexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/under-the-dome/DAs-pet-project-is-now-statewide-example-64311037.html District Attorney program is now statewide example]</ref> it was revised to address this concern.

====Death penalty====
Harris is personally opposed to the death penalty, but has said that she would review each case individually.<ref name="sfbg.com">[http://www.sfbg.com/blogs/politics/2009/09/give_kamala_harris_credit_for.html San Francisco Bay Guardian - Give Kamala Harris Credit for Intregrity]</ref> Her position was tested in April 2004, when [[San Francisco Police Department|SFPD]] Officer Isaac Espinoza was murdered in the Bayview district. Harris announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing. The decision sparked protests from the San Francisco Police Officers Association, Sen. [[Dianne Feinstein]], and others.  Those who supported the decision not to seek the death penalty included actor [[Mike Farrell]], San Francisco Supervisors [[Tom Ammiano]] and [[Sophie Maxwell]], in whose Bayview district the murder occurred.<ref>[http://www.basetree.com/photos/sets/photography39.html Basetree - Don't Kill in Our Name, Rally to Support Kamala Harris]</ref>  The jury found the convicted killer, David Hill, guilty of only second degree murder despite the prosecutor, Harry Dorfman, seeking a first degree murder conviction.<ref name="SF Sentinel">[http://www.sanfranciscosentinel.com/?p=1353 Police Officer Isaac Espinoza killer gets two consecutive life sentences â€” No possibility of parole]</ref> The defense argued that Hill thought Espinoza was a member of a rival gang attacking his territory and was able to persuade the jury that the murder was not premeditated. Hill was given the maximum sentence for the conviction, life without the possibility of parole.<ref name="SF Sentinel" />

Harris' position against the death penalty was tested again in the case of [[Edwin Ramos]], an [[illegal immigrant]] and alleged [[MS-13]] gang member who was accused of murdering Tony Bologna and his sons Michael and Matthew.<ref name="latimes.com">Finnegan, Michael. [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-harris22-2009jun22,0,3668981,full.story "San Francisco D.A.'s program trained illegal immigrants for jobs they couldn't legally hold"], ''Los Angeles Times'', June 22, 2009.</ref> On September 10, 2009 Harris announced she would seek "life in prison without the possibility of parole," rather than the death penalty in the Ramos case.<ref name="The San Francisco Chronicle">Van Derbeken, Jaxon. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/11/BAM819L7NE.DTL "Edwin Ramos won't face death penalty"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', September 11, 2009.</ref> A judge has recently dismissed a lawsuit by the family against the city of San Francisco that claims the city contributed to the deaths of Danielle Bolognaâ€™s husband, Anthony Bologna, and two of their sons, through its sanctuary city policy.<ref name="The San Francisco Examiner lawsuit drop">[http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Judge-dismisses-Bologna-family-lawsuit-against-SF-85227152.html Judge dismisses Bologna family lawsuit against SF]</ref>

Harris believes that life without possibility of parole is a more efficient, and cost effective, punishment.<ref name="CA Capitol">[http://californiascapitol.com/blog/?p=341 San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris]</ref> According to the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, the death penalty conservatively costs $137 million per year.<ref name="CCAFJ report">[http://www.ccfaj.org/documents/CCFAJFinalReport.pdf California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice report]</ref> If the system were changed to life without possibility of parole, the annual costs would be approximately $12 million per year.<ref name="CCAFJ report" /> Harris noted that the resulting surplus could put 1,000 more police officers into service in San Francisco alone.<ref name="CA Capitol" />

====Violent crimes, felons, incarceration rate, and conviction rate====
As San Francisco District Attorney, Harris has raised the overall felony conviction rate from 52% in 2003 to 67% in 2006, the highest in a decade, secured an 85% conviction rate for homicides, and increased convictions of drug dealers from 56% in 2003 to 74% in 2006.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/34 "Convicting Felons"]</ref>  While these statistics represent only trial convictions, she has also closed many cases via plea bargains.  When she took office, she took a special interest in clearing some of the murder caseload from the previous administration.  Harris claimed that the records were less than optimal from the previous administration, and worked to get convictions on what she could. That meant that out of the 73 homicide cases backlogged, 32 cases took deals for lesser charges such as manslaughter or took pleas to other crimes such as assault or burglary while the murder charges were dismissed.<ref>Van Derbeken, Jaxon. [http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-03-20/news/17287759_1_conviction-handling-of-criminal-cases-homicide/4 "Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', March 20, 2006, p. 4.</ref>

However, critics argue that San Francisco sends fewer people to jail per arrest than other counties throughout the state.  The San Francisco DA's incarceration rates are among the lowest in the entire state of Californiaâ€”fully 10 times lower than in San Diego County, for example. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, "roughly 4 of every 100 arrests result in prison terms in San Francisco, compared with 12.8 out of 100 in Alameda County, 14.4 of 100 in Sacramento County, 21 of 100 in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, 26.6 of 100 in Fresno County, 38.7 of 100 in Los Angeles County and 41 of 100 in San Diego County." <ref name="Police1">[http://www.policeone.com/community-policing/articles/1203289-San-Francisco-chief-calls-justice-system-too-lenient/]</ref> Police also note that lenient sentencing from San Francisco judges also plays a role in this.<ref name="Police1" />

While officers within the SFPD have credited Harris with tightening loopholes in bail and drug programs that defendants have exploited in the past, they have also accused her of being too deliberate in her prosecution of murder suspects.<ref>Van Derbeken, Jaxon. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/03/20/MNG01HQVPA1.DTL#ixzz0jKyN3hF9 "Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', March 20, 2006.</ref> Additionally, in 2009 San Francisco prosecutors won a lower percentage of their felony jury trials than their counterparts at district attorneys' offices covering the 10 largest cities in California, according to data on case outcomes compiled by officials at the San Francisco Superior Court as well as by other county courts and prosecutors. (Officials in Sacramento, the state's seventh-largest city, did not provide data.) Harris' at-trial felony conviction rate that year was 76 percent, down 12 points from the previous year. By contrast, the most recent recorded statewide average was 83 percent, according to statistics from the California Judicial Council.<ref name="Lack of Conviction">Jamison, Peter. [http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-05-05/news/a-lack-of-conviction/ "A Lack of Conviction"], ''SF Weekly'', May 5, 2010.</ref> In a small sample, a report computed that the conviction rate for felony trials in San Francisco County in the first three months of 2010 was just 53%.<ref name="Lack of Conviction" /> San Francisco has historically had one of the lowest conviction rates in the state; the county is known for a defendant friendly jury pool.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=LJX3Ql7bu2YC&pg=PA960&lpg=PA960&dq=%22San+Francisco%22+%22low+conviction+rates%22&source=bl&ots=HXTEnRYxEn&sig=vmg9v_NFzcZvGAWjVEmv7-3m-FM&hl=en&ei=5LIGTKO7Ko_8NcqY2MYJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22San%20Francisco%22%20%22low%20conviction%20rates%22&f=false Encyclopedia of crime and punishment, Volume 1 By David Levinson]</ref><ref name="sfweekly.com">{{cite web|author=Peter Jamison |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-05-05/news/a-lack-of-conviction/ |title=A Lack of Conviction - Page 1 - News - San Francisco |publisher=SF Weekly |date=2010-05-05 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>

====Hate Crimes and Civil Rights====
Harris has created a special Hate Crimes Unit as San Francisco District Attorney. She has focused on hate crimes against [[LGBT]] children and teens in schools. She convened a national conference to confront the "gay-transgender panic defense", which has been used to justify violent hate crimes.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/113 "Hate Crimes and Protecting Victims"]</ref> Harris supports same-sex marriage in California and opposed both [[Proposition 22]] and [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]].<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/MarriageEquality "Marriage Equality"]</ref>

In 2004, The [[National Urban League]] honored Harris as a "Woman of Power" and she received the [[Thurgood Marshall#Thurgood Marshall Award|Thurgood Marshall Award]] from the National Black Prosecutors Association in 2005. In her campaign for California Attorney General, she has received the endorsements of numerous groups, including the abortion rights [[EMILY's List]], California Legislative Black Caucus, Asian American Action Fund, Black Women Organized for Political Action, Mexican American Bar Association, South Asians for Opportunity, and the National Women's Political Caucus.<ref name="Endorsements">[http://kamalaharris.org/endorsements "Endorsements"]</ref>

Kamala Harris has been vocal in the immigration debate, and supporting San Francisco's immigration policy<ref>Jesse McKinley (11/16/06) [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/us/12sanctuary.html Immigrant Protection Rules Draw Fire] The New York Times.  Retrieved 10-28-10.</ref> over Arizona's approach, arguing that it is important that immigrants be able to talk with law enforcement without fear.<ref>Anthony York (10/5/10) [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2010/10/steve-cooleykamala-harris-debate-the-arizona-immigration-law.html Attorney general debate: The Arizona immigration law]</ref>

====Education====
In interviews with [[Matt Lauer]] on ''[[The Today Show]]'' and local [[KGO-TV]], Harris argued for treating "habitual and chronic truancy" among children in elementary school as a crime committed by the parents of truant children. She argues that there is a direct connection between habitual truancy in elementary school and crime later in life.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i0tpAqrDDY "KGO/ABC 7's View from the Bay's Interview with Kamala Harris on Truancy Rates"]</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-c-4FlgUT0 "Kamala Harris on the Today Show"]</ref> She has received the endorsement of the California Federation of Teachers.<ref name="Endorsements" />

====Endorsements====
In her campaign for California Attorney General, Harris has received the endorsements of [[United Farm Workers]] co-founder [[Dolores Huerta]], United Educators of San Francisco, and the San Francisco Firefighters Local 798.<ref name="Endorsements" /> She has also received the endorsement of [[Antonio Villaraigosa]], the current Mayor of Los Angeles.<ref name="newsline"/>

====Environment====
During her time as San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created the Environmental Justice Unit in the San Francisco District Attorneyâ€™s Office<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Jason B.|title=SAN FRANCISCO / D.A. creates environmental unit / 3-staff team takes on crime mostly affecting the poor|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-06-01/bay-area/17376837_1_environmental-justice-bird-droppings-san-francisco-city-hall|accessdate=August 20, 2010|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 1, 2005}}</ref> and has prosecuted several industries and individuals for pollution, most notably [[U-Haul]], Alameda Publishing Corporation, and the [[Cosco Busan oil spill]]. She has also advocated for strong enforcement of environmental protection laws.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/613 "Protecting the Environment"]</ref>

====Financial crimes====
Harris has prosecuted numerous financial crimes throughout her career, particularly those affecting elders, those involving use of high-technology, and identity theft.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/594 "Prosecuting Financial Crimes"]</ref> She has indicated that as attorney general she would crack down on [[predatory lending]] and other financial crimes.<ref>{{cite news|title=S.F. attorney Kamala Harris enters attorney general race|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zfQlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=U_0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=3372,1028608&dq=kamala-harris+financial+crime&hl=en|accessdate=August 20, 2010|newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel|date=November 13, 2008}}</ref>

====Police department laboratory and disclosure failures====
San Francisco Police Department drug lab technician Deborah Madden admitted to taking amounts of [[cocaine]] from evidence samples in the police department's crime lab. The testing unit of the police department lab was shut down on March 9, 2010. Since then, hundreds of drug cases have either been dismissed or discharged due to evidentiary requirements. While Harris' office was aware of troubling issues at the police department's drug lab months before the issue became public, the entire scope of the issues did not become clear until Madden was exposed for removing drug samples.<ref>{{cite web|author=8:21 PDT |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/SFPD-drug-lab-technician-issues-not-addressed-90907184.html#ixzz0nkuMJLsz |title=Drug lab technician issues not addressed &#124; San Francisco Examiner |publisher=Sfexaminer.com |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref> The police department later widened the investigation into their crime lab to include cases that were already prosecuted.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-04-03/news/20833423_1_drug-lab-crime-lab-drug-cases |title=Kamala Harris faces tough questions in race - SFGate |publisher=Articles.sfgate.com |date=2010-04-03 |accessdate=2010-07-28 | first=Marisa | last=Lagos}}</ref>

On May 4, 2010, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported that a number of felony convictions were in jeopardy when it was revealed that the prosecuting attorneys did not disclose criminal backgrounds for relevant San Francisco police officers before testifying.<ref name="articles.sfgate.com">{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-05-04/news/20883129_1_police-officers-cocaine-cases-police-disciplinary-cases |title=S.F. cops' pasts could jeopardize convictions - SFGate |publisher=Articles.sfgate.com |date=2010-05-04 |accessdate=2010-07-28 | first=Jaxon | last=Van Derbeken}}</ref>  On May 20, 2010, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo ruled that prosecutors had violated defendants' rights by failing to disclose damaging information about the police drug lab technician. The judge concluded that prosecutors had failed to fulfill their constitutional duty to tell defense attorneys about problems surrounding Deborah Madden, the now-retired technician at the heart of the cocaine-skimming scandal that led police to shut down the drug analysis section of their crime lab. Harris' office has been unable to vouch for the reliability of Madden's work and has dismissed more than 600 drug cases since the scandal became public in February. Madden testified at trials before leaving the lab in December. Under a 1963 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling, ''[[Brady v. Maryland]]'', district attorneys are obligated to provide defense attorneys with information in their possession about prosecution witnesses that could be used to challenge their credibility.
 
Massullo wrote that top drug prosecutor Assistant District Attorney Sharon Woo's November 19 memo about Madden to Russ Giuntini, Chief Assistant District Attorney, and Jeffrey Ross, head of the criminal division, showed that prosecutors "at the highest levels of the district attorney's office knew that Madden was not a dependable witness at trial and that there were serious concerns regarding the crime lab".<ref>{{cite web|author=8:21 PDT |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/SFPD-drug-lab-technician-issues-not-addressed-90907184.html#ixzz0pl0VitGe |title=Drug lab technician issues not addressed &#124; San Francisco Examiner |publisher=Sfexaminer.com |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref> The failure by Harris' office "to produce information actually in its possession regarding Madden and the crime lab is a violation of the defendants' constitutional rights," Massullo wrote. The Judge said that the prosecutors had the "duty to implement some type of procedure to secure and produce information relevant to Madden's criminal history." But Massullo said her repeated requests that prosecutors explain why they did not have such procedures were met with "a level of indifference." However, Judge Massullo refused to dismiss any cases, saying that all cases must be considered individually.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/05/21/BAN01DHVMU.DTL#ixzz0od05q8Qb |title=Judge rips Harris' office for hiding problems |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2010-07-28 | first=Jaxon | last=Van Derbeken}}</ref>

On May 26, 2010, the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' reported that a San Francisco coroner's supervising toxicologist, Ann Marie Gordon, vouched for blood-test results in drunken-driving cases for two years before prosecutors told defense attorneys that a Washington state court had labeled her as a "perpetrator of fraud" while running that state's toxicology lab. San Francisco prosecutors began telling defense attorneys about Gordon's past after the ''Chronicle'' reported earlier in May 2010 that scores of police officers had criminal arrests or misconduct cases that were never called to defendants' attention before trials. Prosecutors are obligated to provide potentially exculpatory information about their witnesses to the defense under the 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/05/26/MNJP1DJPEN.DTL#ixzz0pAuhDNOD |title=Problems of S.F. toxicologist not disclosed |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2010-07-28 | first=Jaxon | last=Van Derbeken}}</ref>
