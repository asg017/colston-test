====Campaign organization====
[[File:Congresswoman Pelosi meets San Francisco's District Attorney, Kamala Harris; March 30, 2004.jpg|thumb|Harris with Congresswoman [[Nancy Pelosi]], 2004]]
Harris was reportedly so angry about the discontent in Terence Hallinan's office that she decided to run against him.<ref name=Karma/>  She began "methodically gathering support" by attending political events, volunteering on other campaigns, assuming [[Board of directors|board memberships]] on nonprofits, being seen at exclusive parties, and presenting herself as an alternative to a "political has-been."<ref name=Karma/> When Harris announced her candidacy, she had served on the board of trustees of the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco]], had been a member of [[SFJAZZ Center|San Francisco Jazz Organization]], was a patron dinner chair for the [[San Francisco Symphony|San Francisco Symphony's]] Black & White Ball, was the executive director of the San Francisco Domestic Violence Consortium, led the board of directors of Partners Ending Domestic Abuse, and was a board member of nonprofit, Women Count.<ref name=Launched/>

In mid-2002, Harris called Mark Buell, the stepfather of her friend, [[Walker family|Summer Tompkins Walker]], and told him of her intention to run for District Attorney.<ref name=Launched/>  Buell was married to major Democratic megadonor, [[Susie Tompkins Buell]].  Buell, impressed by Harris, offered to be her [[Political campaign staff|finance chair]].<ref name=Launched/> Buell advised that to beat an incumbent, Harris would need to raise more than $150,000, the highest amount ever raised to campaign for the position.

{{main|Fajitagate}}

Hallinan was running for re-election amidst the backdrop of the [[Fajitagate]] scandal, in which three off-duty police officers got into a fight with residents over a bag of fajitas, leading to lawsuits and allegations of police misconduct. Hallinan alleged that [[Prentice E. Sanders]], the city's first black Chief of Police,  and other officers were involved in a coverup of the initial criminal acts of the three off-duty officers, indicting all of them for [[obstruction of justice]] in February 2003. Sanders resigned, but Hallinan was forced to drop the charges against Sanders less than a month later when he was unable to prove evidence of a conspiracy. <ref>{{cite news|first1=Dean|last1=Murphy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/12/us/case-against-police-chief-is-dropped-in-san-francisco.html|title=Case Against Police Chief is Dropped in San Francisco|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 12, 2003}}</ref> Sanders pursued legal action to clear his name and was declared factually innocent<ref>{{cite news|first1=Jaxson|last1=VanDerbeken|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Court-finds-S-F-chief-factually-innocent-2597925.html|title=Court finds S.F. chief 'factually innocent' / Sanders' mug shot taken after arrest in Fajitagate case to be destroyed|publisher=SFGate|date=August 7, 2003}}</ref>Hallinan was seen to have damaged his credibility in the wake of the incident.

In 2004, Harris recruited civil rights activist [[Lateefah Simon]], the youngest woman to ever receive a [[MacArthur Fellowship]], to create San Francisco Reentry Division.  The flagship program was the Back on Track initiative, a first-of-its-kind reentry program for nonviolent, first-time offenders age 18-30. Initiative participants whose crimes were not weapon or gang-related would plead guilty in exchange for a deferral of sentencing and regular appearances before a judge over a 12 to 18-month period. The program maintained rigorous graduation requirements, mandating successful completion of up to 220 hours of community service, obtaining a [[High school equivalency degree|high-school-equivalency diploma]], maintaining steady employment, taking parenting classes, and passing drug tests. At graduation, the court would dismiss the original case and expunge the graduate's record.<ref name="Fraley">{{cite web|first=Malaika|last=Fraley|url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2009/10/26/book-em-kamala-s-f-district-attorney-harris-adds-author-to-list-of-credits/|title=Book 'em, Kamala{{snd}}S.F.

====Truancy initiative====
In 2006, as part of an initiative to reduce the city skyrocketing homicide rate, Harris led a city-wide effort with Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]], Police Chief [[Heather Fong]], and various local leaders to combat [[truancy]] for at-risk elementary school youth in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Heather|last=Knight|title=City opens campaign to cut truancy by thousands of students|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=105D3AF9CE92404E&p_docnum=16&s_dlid=DL0120050214473400976&s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&s_trackval=&s_siteloc=&s_referrer=&s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F15%2F2030&s_docsbal=%20&s_subexpires=12%2F15%2F2030&s_docstart=&s_docsleft=&s_docsread=&s_username=refuser&s_accountid=AC0114070818394531470&s_upgradeable=no|accessdate=May 1, 2020 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 19, 2004}}</ref> Declaring chronic truancy a matter of public safety and pointing out that the vast majority of prison inmates and homicide victims are dropouts or habitual truants, Harris' office met with thousands of parents at high-risk schools and sent out letters warning all families of the legal consequences of truancy at the beginning of the fall semester, adding she would prosecute the parents of chronically truant younger students: penalties included a $2,500 fine and up to a year in jail.<ref name="Knight">{{cite news|first=Heather|last=Knight|title=City trying to get worst truants to school.

In 2008, Harris issued citations against six parents whose young children missed at least 50 days of school, the first time [[San Francisco]] prosecuted adults for student truancy.  San Francisco's school chief, Carlos Garcia, stated that the path from truancy to parental prosecution was lengthy, and that the school district usually spends months encouraging parents to send their children to school through phone calls, reminder letters, private meetings, hearings before the School Attendance Review Board, and offers of help from city agencies and social services; two of the six parents entered no plea but said they would work with the DA's office and social service agencies to create "parental responsibility plans" to help them start sending their children to school regularly.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nanette|last=Asimov|title=Citations go to parents of truant kids|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=1213DEC077C76F28&p_docnum=9&s_dlid=DL0120050214581526325&s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&s_trackval=&s_siteloc=&s_referrer=&s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F15%2F2030&s_docsbal=%20&s_subexpires=12%2F15%2F2030&s_docstart=&s_docsleft=&s_docsread=&s_username=refuser&s_accountid=AC0114070818394531470&s_upgradeable=no|accessdate=May 2, 2020 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 11, 2008}}</ref>

By the end of April 2009, there were 1,330 elementary school students who were habitual or chronic truants, down from 1,730 in 2008,  2,517 in 2007 and 2,856 in 2006. This amounted to a staggering 23% drop since the 2005–06 school year. In so doing, the school districts referred 110 elementary school families to a review board, up from 34 the year before. <ref name="SFGate">{{cite news|title=Fighting truancy yields big dividends

While Harris oversaw more than 1900 convictions for marijuana, lawyers working in her office stated that most defendants for low-level marijuana possession were never locked up or even charged with a crime, as consistent with the city and county's low priority for possession crimes. Only 45 people were sentenced to state prison for marijuana trafficking. <ref>{{cite news|first=Casey|last=Tolan|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/09/11/kamala-harris-prosecuting-marijuana-cases/|title=Campaign fact check: Here’s how Kamala Harris really prosecuted marijuana cases|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>

==== Hate crimes ====
{{main|Murder of Gwen Araujo}}
Harris also created a special Hate Crimes Unit, focusing on [[hate crime]]s against [[LGBT]] children and teens in schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kamalaharris.org/MarriageEquality|title=Marriage Equality|publisher=Kamalaharris.org|accessdate=November 18, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125112342/http://kamalaharris.org/MarriageEquality|archivedate=November 25, 2010}}</ref> In early 2006, [[Gwen Araujo]], a 17-year old American Latina transgender teenager was murdered by two men who later used the "[[gay panic defense]]" before being convicted of second-degree murder.

We can't outlaw it, but we can combat it."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/462922087/ |title=Harris challenges 'gay panic' strategy|page=4 |date=July 5, 2006 |newspaper=The San Francisco Examiner }}</ref>Harris subsequently supported A.B. 1160, the Gwen Araujo Justice for Victims Act, advocating that California's penal code include jury instructions to ignore bias, sympathy, prejudice or public opinion in making their decision, also making mandatory for district attorney's offices in California to educate prosecutors about panic strategies and how to prevent bias from affecting trial outcomes.<ref name="AB 1160"/> In September 2006, California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] signed A.B. 1160 into law; the law put California on record as declaring it contrary to public policy for defendants to be acquitted or convicted of a [[lesser included offense]] on the basis of appeals to "societal bias".<ref name="AB 1160">{{cite web

====Public corruption====
In 2005,  Harris obtained a guilty plea from former San Francisco school official Tim Tronson for fraud and tax evasion. Tronson was originally charged with 22 felony counts in connection with the alleged scheme to divert $500,000 out of a construction escrow account to be paid to an outfit under the control of another consultant, Alpha Omega Bibbs III. Bibbs then allegedly gave the money back to Tronson in the form of checks, who went to a Santa Cruz check cashing facility to convert at least $350,000 from the checks into money orders.  Tronson served four years in state prison and was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and $500,000 in restitution.<ref>{{cite news|title=SAN FRANCISCO / Ex-schools official guilty of fraud, gets 4 years / Consultant oversaw construction account|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-Ex-schools-official-guilty-of-2661240.php|accessdate=May 3, 2020 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 21, 2006}}</ref>

In 2006, Republican [[Ed Jew]] won a highly competitive election to the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]].

Facing an arrest warrant and nine felony charges, Jew turned himself in.<ref name="sfexaminer.com"/>Thereafter, Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] suspended Jew and began the process of removing him from office.  On January 10, 2008, Jew resigned, swearing never to seek public office again. On October 10, 2008, Jew pleaded guilty to federal mail fraud and extortion charges and state perjury charges and was sentenced to 64 months in state prison, fined $10,000 for the federal extortion charge, and another $2000 on the perjury charge.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former S.F. supervisor pleads guilty to federal extortion, bribery, plans to accuse others|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2008%2F10%2F10%2FBARK13EVU2.DTL|accessdate=May 2, 2020 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 11, 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081011190856/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2008%2F10%2F10%2FBARK13EVU2.DTL|archive-date = October 11, 2008}}</ref>

==== Violent crime====
In the early 2000s, the [[City and County of San Francisco]] murder rate per capita drastically outpaced the national average.  When Harris took office, she cleared part of the murder caseload from the previous administration. She stated that the records from that administration were less than ideal, and worked to get convictions on what she could.

Harris also pushed for higher bail for criminal [[defendant]]s involved in gun-related crimes, arguing that historically low [[bail]] encouraged outsiders to commit crimes in San Francisco. Officers within the [[San Francisco Police Department]] credited Harris with tightening [[loophole]]s in bail and drug programs that defendants had used in the past.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jaxon|last=Van Derbeken|url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Trials-and-tribulations-of-Kamala-Harris-D-A-2521498.php |title=Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=March 20, 2006|accessdate=March 9, 2019}}</ref>In addition to creating a gun crime unit, Harris opposed releasing defendants on their own recognizance if they were arrested on gun crimes, sought minimum 90-day sentences for possession of concealed or loaded weapons, and charged all assault weapons possession cases as felonies, adding that she would seek prison terms for criminals who possess or use assault weapons and maximum penalties on gun-related crimes:<ref name="Garofoli">{{cite news|last=Garofoli|first=Joe |url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/joegarofoli/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-D-A-vows-to-go-after-gun-law-2755194.php |title=SAN FRANCISCO / D.A. vows to go after gun law violators / Harris takes tough approach, pledges maximum penalties|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=May 29, 2004|accessdate=May 2, 2020}}</ref>

In April 2005, Harris pursued the prosecution of Charles Rothenberg a.k.a. Charley Charles, under California's [[three strikes law]] for illegal possession of a firearm.  Rothenberg became infamous in the 1980s when he set his 6-year-old son on fire amidst a custody dispute with his ex-wife.  Rothenberg previously served 6 1/2 years in prison for dousing the hotel room in kerosene and setting it ablaze with his son was asleep. Having been convicted of attempted murder and arson, and now illegal firearm possession, Rothernberg's act constituted a third "strike" under state law and triggering a sentence of 25 years to life in prison.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marisa |last=Lagos |url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Rothenberg-sentenced-25-years-to-life-under-2567011.php |title=Rothenberg sentenced 25 years to life under three-strike law |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=April 4, 2007 }}</ref>

In August 2007, State Assemblyman [[Mark Leno]] introduced legislation to ban gun shows at the [[Cow Palace]] in [[Daly City, CA]], joined by Harris, Police Chief [[Heather Fong]] and Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]].  City leaders contended the shows were directly contributing to the proliferation of illegal guns and spiking homicide rates in San Francisco: Mayor Newsom earlier that month signed into law local legislation banning gun shows on city and county property. Leno alleged that gun show merchants drove through the public housing developments near the arena, including Sunnydale, and illegally sold weapons to residents.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marisa |last=Lagos |url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Measure-would-ban-gun-shows-at-Cow-Palace-2526741.php |title=Measure would ban gun shows at Cow Palace

In the general election, she faced [[Los Angeles County]] District Attorney [[Steve Cooley]], who led the race in polling until the final moments. Cooley ran as a nonpartisan prosecutor, distancing himself from the [[2010 California gubernatorial election|Meg Whitman campaign]]. However, during a debate on October 5, Cooley complained about the low salary of the attorney general, stating his intention to accept a pension and the salary in a practice known as "double-dipping." Harris' turned his remarks into a cutting political ad that portrayed Cooley as out-of-touch.  Cooley did not respond with a negative ad of his own until the last two weeks of the campaign, attacking Harris on her refusal to seek the death penalty in the Espinoza case.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.laweekly.com/how-steve-cooley-blew-it-the-definitive-post-mortem/ |first=Gene |last=Maddaus |title=HOW STEVE COOLEY BLEW IT: THE DEFINITIVE POST-MORTEM|work=LA Weekly|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref>

===Civil rights===
====LGBTQ rights====
{{main|Hollingsworth v. Perry}}
In 2008, California voters passed [[2008 California Proposition 8|Prop 8]], a [[California ballot proposition]] and a state constitutional amendment defining marriage between a man and a woman.  Legal challenges to Prop 8 were presented by opponents quickly after its approval. Following affirmation by the state courts, two same-sex couples filed a lawsuit against the initiative in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in the case [[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]] (later [[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]).

In August 2010, Chief Judge [[Vaughn Walker]] ruled that the amendment was unconstitutional under both the [[Due Process Clause|Due Process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] Clauses of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Judge strikes down Prop. 8, allows gay marriage in California |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/08/prop8-gay-marriage.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}</ref> since it purported to ''re-remove'' rights from a disfavored class only, with no [[Rational basis review|rational basis]].

On February 7, 2012, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]], in a 2–1 decision, reached the same conclusion as the district court, but on narrower grounds. The court ruled that it was unconstitutional for California to grant marriage rights to same-sex couples, only to take them away shortly after. The ruling was stayed pending appeal to the United States Supreme Court.<ref name="auto16">http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2012/02/07/1016696com.pdf</ref>

On December 7, 2012, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] granted certiorari, ordering the parties to brief and argue the additional question of whether supporters of Prop. 8 have standing, i.e., a legal right to be involved in the case, under Article III, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution.<ref name="auto16"/> In February 2013, Harris filed an [[Amicus curiae]] brief with the Court, arguing that Prop 8 was unconstitutional and that initiative's sponsors did not have the right to claim to represent the interests of California by defending the law in federal court.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-files-us-supreme-court-brief-support-marriage |title=Attorney General Kamala D.

On June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court issued its decision on the appeal in the case ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'', ruling that proponents of initiatives such as Proposition 8 did not possess [[Standing (law)|legal standing]] in their own right to defend the resulting law in [[United States federal courts|federal court]], either to the Supreme Court or (previously) to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]]. Therefore, the Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Ninth Circuit, and remanded the case for further proceedings.

On June 27, 2013, Harris, in a speech delivered in downtown Los Angeles, declared that all 58 counties in California must abide by Judge Walker's 2010 ruling that declared Prop 8 unconstitutional and urging  the Ninth Circuit to lift the stay on same-sex marriages as soon as possible — even before the usual 25-day waiting period until the Supreme Court clerk notifies the lower court of its judgement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-prop-8_n_3505292|title=Kamala Harris On Prop 8 Decision: Same-Sex Marriages In California Should Begin Immediately|first=Anna|last=Almendrala|date=June 27, 2013|work=HuffPost}}</ref> The next day, the Ninth Circuit, on remand, dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and dissolved their previous stay of the district court's ruling, enabling Governor [[Jerry Brown]] to order same-sex marriages to resume.<ref name="latimes.com"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Dolan |first=Maura |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-prop-8-gay-marriage-20130628,0,1889039.story |title=Prop 8: Gay marriages can resume in California, court rules |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref> The same day, Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier, plaintiffs in the case, married with Harris officiating the ceremony.<ref>{{cite news|first=Matt|last=Baume|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-gay-marriage-resumes-20130628-story.html|title=Kamala Harris officiating Prop 8 plaintiffs' San Francisco wedding|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 28, 2013|accessdate=April 29, 2020}}</ref>

In 2012, [[conversion therapy|conversion therapists]] filed two lawsuits, ''Pickup v. Brown'' (12-17681) and ''Welch v.

On February 12, 2015, Harris announced that she would start a new agency called the Bureau of Children's Justice.

====Law enforcement capabilities ====
California's [[2004 California Proposition 69|Proposition 69]] mandated law enforcement to collect DNA samples from any adult arrested for a felony and from individuals arrested for certain crimes.  In 2012, Harris announced that the [[California Department of Justice]] had improved its DNA testing capabilities such that samples stored at the state's seven crime labs could now be analyzed four times faster, within 30 days.  Accordingly, Harris revealed that her officials cleared California's entire DNA backlog for the first time ever.  Harris' Rapid DNA Service Team within the Bureau of Forensic Services, developed a process that allowed higher volume analysis of 5,400 evidence samples – an increase of 11% from 2010 (4,800) and 24% from 2009 (4,100).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2012/01/california-dna-evidence-attorney-general.html|title=California attorney general says DNA backlog is gone||newspaper= [[LA Times]]|date=January 25, 2012}}</ref> In April 2014, Harris' team was honored with the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]'s Award for Professional Innovation in Victim Services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/04/08/attorney-general-kamala-harris-honored-for-rape-kit-processing/|title=Attorney General Kamala Harris Honored For Rape Kit Processing|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[CBS Sacramento]]|date=April 8, 2014}}</ref>Harris' office would later be awarded a $1.6 million grant from the [[Manhattan District Attorney]]'s initiative to eliminate the backlogs of untested [[rape kits]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.turlockjournal.com/news/crime/grant-awarded-to-test-rape-kits/|title=Grant awarded to test rape kits

In 2014, after a rash of racially motivated police killings nationwide and immediately after being elected to her second term, Harris conducted an extensive 90-day review of [[implicit bias]] and use of force.<ref name="San Jose Mercury News">{{cite news |title=California: Kamala Harris announces police anti-bias training program|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/04/17/california-kamala-harris-announces-police-anti-bias-training-program/|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]] |date=April 17, 2015|accessdate=April 30, 2020}}</ref> In April 2015, Harris introduced the first of its kind "''Principled Policing: Procedural Justice and Implicit Bias''" training course, designed in conjunction with [[Stanford University]] psychologist and professor [[Jennifer Eberhardt]], to help law enforcement officers overcome barriers to neutral policing and rebuild the relationship of trust between law enforcement and the community.<ref name="San Jose Mercury News"/> All Command-level staff within the [[California Department of Justice]] received the training, while additional resources were deployed to increase the recruitment and hiring of diverse special agents and trainees.<ref name="San Jose Mercury News"/> 

In September 2015, Harris, alongside Congresswoman [[Karen Bass]], [[Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD Chief]] [[Charlie Beck]], and UC Berkeley professor of public policy [[Steven Raphael]] announced the launch of OpenJustice, a first-in-the-nation criminal justice data initiative making available statewide data on arrest rates, deaths in law enforcement custody, arrest-related deaths, and law enforcement deaths.  The tool consisted of two components: a Dashboard that spotlights key criminal justice indicators with user-friendly visualization tools and an Open Data Portal that publishes raw data from the California Department of Justice's statewide repository of criminal justice datasets. Subsequent improvements to the platform revealed data pertaining to clearance rates and racial disparities in the criminal justice system <ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/17/california-dojs-openjustice-platform-makes-local-law-enforcement-data-more-transparent/|title=California's DOJ OpenJustice Platform Makes Local Law Enforcement Data More Transparent|work=[[TechCrunch]]|date=February 17, 2016}}</ref>

Later that year, Harris' Justice Department was the first statewide agency in the country to require all of its police officers to wear [[body cameras]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/live-updates/general-election/fact-checking-the-first-democratic-debate/harris-on-requiring-police-to-wear-body-cameras/?arc404=true|title=Harris on requiring police to wear body cameras|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 27, 2019}}</ref>Harris said she believed that all officers should wear cameras, but did not believe in imposing statewide standards to regulate the use of body cameras, cautioning against a "one-size-fits-all approach." <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-harris-body-cameras-20150527-story.html|title=Kamala Harris cautions against ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach on body cameras|work=[[LA Times]]|date=May 27, 2015}}</ref>

==== Law enforcement misconduct ====
In 2015, a [[California superior courts]] judge issued an order to eject all 250 prosecutors from the Orange County District Attorney's office from a high-profile mass murder case over allegations of "significant" misconduct by [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] District Attorney [[Tony Rackauckas]], who was alleged to have illegally employed jailhouse informants and concealed evidence.<ref name="NYTmag" />

The [[U.S. Department of Justice]] began an investigation into Rackauckas in December 2016, but he was not re-elected to office; his successor [[Todd Spitzer]] later stated his office willing to undergo federal probation to end the investigation <ref>{{cite news |first=Tony |last=Saavedra |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2019/02/25/new-orange-county-da-willing-to-undergo-federal-probation-to-end-snitch-investigation/|title=New Orange County DA willing to undergo federal probation to end 'snitch' investigation|date=February 25, 2019|website=TheOCRegister|accessdate=May 1, 2020}}</ref>

==== Recidivism====
In November 2013, Harris launched the [[California Department of Justice]]'s Division of Recidivism Reduction and Re-Entry in partnership with district attorney offices in [[San Diego]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Alameda County]]. Building off her successful Back on Track program, the division was formed to develop a consistent definition of recidivism, allocate grants for anti-recidivism programs, and creating recidivism metrics through the use of data. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-initiative-reduce-recidivismr|title=Attorney General Kamala D. Harris Launches Initiative to Reduce Recidivism in California |accessdate=May 9, 2020|date=November 20, 2013}}</ref>In March 2015, Harris announced the creation of a recidivism reduction pilot program in coordination with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department called "Back on Track LA." Like her Back on Track program, individuals participating in the pilot program for 24-30 months, and included non-serious, non-violent and non-sexual criminal offenders between 18 and 30. Assigned a case manager or coach, participants received education through a partnership with the [[Los Angeles Community College District]] and job training services. <ref>{{cite news |title=Sheriff, AG Harris Unveil Program to Curb Recidivism|url=https://scvnews.com/sheriff-ag-harris-unveil-program-to-curb-recidivism/|first=Alex |last=Veiga |agency=SCV News|date=Mar 11, 2015}}</ref>

A 2018 assessment of the Back on Track LA pilot program by the [[American Society of Criminology]] found that graduates showed significantly higher self-esteem and decision-making ability, significantly lower levels of depression, entitlement, criminal rationalization, justification of antisocial behavior, and personal irresponsibility compared to the control group. On balance, the results showed that Back on Track LA was effective in showing significant decrease on general propensity for recidivism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/research/bot-la-2018-ASC.pdf|title=Program Evaluation: Back on Track–LA |accessdate=May 9, 2020|date=2018}}</ref>

In 2011, Harris announced the creation of the Mortgage Fraud Strike Force, consisting of a consumer enforcement team, a criminal enforcement team, and a corporate fraud team. <ref>{{cite news |title=Calif. creates task force to probe mortgage fraud|url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-calif-creates-task-force-to-probe-mortgage-fraud-2011may23-story.html|first=Alex |last=Veiga |agency=San Diego Union Tribune |date=May 23, 2011}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, Harris announced a joint investigatory alliance with Nevada Attorney General [[Catherine Cortez Masto]] to combine investigative resources and strategy, as California and Nevada were the two states hit hardest in the [[foreclosure crisis]]; California led the nation in total 546,669 foreclosure filings while Nevada led the nation in percentage of foreclosures at 9.4%, or 106,160 housing units.<ref>{{cite news |title=California, Nevada plan joint mortgage fraud investigation|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2011/12/06/california-nevada-harris-mortgage-fraud.html|first=Mark |last=Anderson |agency=Sacramento Business Journal |date=Dec 6, 2011}}</ref> 

In 2011, Harris obtained the largest recovery in the history of California's False Claims Act - $241 million - with [[Quest Diagnostics]], the state's biggest provider of medical laboratory testing, of a lawsuit alleging illegal overcharges to the state's medical program for the poor. <ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-may-20-la-fi-quest-settlement-20110520-story.html|title=Quest Diagnostics settles Medi-Cal whistleblower suit| publisher=LA Times| accessdate=May 11, 2020 | date=May 20, 2011}}</ref>  That same year, Harris obtained yet another record-breaking settlement - $323 million - with the SCAN healthcare network - over excess state Medi-Cal and federal [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] payments.The federal government received receiving $3.82 million for the Medicare portion of the settlement.

In 2012, Harris leveraged California's outsize economic clout as the fifth largest economy in the world to obtain better terms in the [[2010 United States foreclosure crisis|National Mortgage Settlement]] against the nation's five largest banks - [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Bank of America]], [[Wells Fargo]], [[Citigroup]] and [[Ally Bank]].<ref name="Parker">{{cite news | url=https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Kamala-Harris-foreclosure-deal-a-win-for-state-3381270.php |title=Kamala Harris' foreclosure deal a win for state |date=March 5, 2012 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |last=Parker |first=Barbara |first2=Rebecca |last2=Kaplan |accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> In her memoir, ''The Truths We Hold,'' Harris said that initial negotiations with the banks had yielded an offer that amounted to "crumbs," only $2 to $4 billion in relief for California residents.<ref>(Harris, 2019) pg. 95</ref>  Harris indicated to her team that she was prepared to pull out of the settlement negotiations if they weren't willing to increase their offer.

==== Human trafficking ====
In summer 2012, in preparation for a written report on the state of human trafficking in California, Harris signed an accord with her counterpart, the [[Attorney General of Mexico]], [[Marisela Morales]] to improve coordination of law enforcement resources targeting transnational gangs that engage in the sale and trafficking of human beings across the California-Mexico border.

Later that year, Harris announced the arrest of [[Backpage]] CEO Carl Ferrer on felony charges of [[pimping]] a [[Minor (law)|minor]], pimping, and conspiracy to commit pimping.

====Public corruption====
In 2011, Harris won a court order reviving a fraud lawsuit against [[CalPERS]] board member Alfred J.R. Villalobos and former CalPERS chief executive Federico Buenrosto, Jr. after they declared bankruptcy to avoid state charges.

In December 2019, Harris led a group of Democratic Senators in demanding the immediate removal of White House senior adviser [[Stephen Miller (political advisor)|Stephen Miller]] after emails published by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] revealed extensive coordination with far-right website [[Breitbart]] to shape stories related to race and immigration and encouraging writers to draw on material from [[white supremacy]] sources, such as the racist 1973 French novel [[The Camp of the Saints]].

===2020===

Ahead of the [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump]] on January 16, 2020, Harris delivered remarks on the floor of the Senate, stating her views on the integrity of the American justice system and the principle that nobody is above the law:

{{quote|"We now face a choice: will we insist that we have one system of justice that applies equally to all? Or will we continue to have two systems of justice, in which some are above the law? […] This moment in our history will have consequences. The Senate is charged with deciding whether the President of the United States, with all of his power and supposed wealth, will be held accountable for his actions – or whether we will finally live up to the principle: ‘Equal Justice Under Law.’"}}

Harris later asked Senate Judiciary Chairman [[Lindsey Graham]] to halt all judicial nominations during the impeachment trial.<ref>{{cite news |title=Harris calls for judicial nominee freeze during impeachment trial|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/478476-harris-calls-for-judicial-nominee-freeze-during-impeachment-trial |first=Zack |last=Burdryk |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=January 15, 2020}}</ref> Hours later, Senator Graham acquiesced.<ref>{{cite news |title=Senate Judiciary Pauses Nominations for Impeachment Trial (1)|url=https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/senate-judiciary-pauses-nominations-for-impeachment-trial |first=Madison |last=Adler |work=[[Bloomberg Law]] |date=January 15, 2020}}</ref> Along with her Democratic colleagues, Harris voted to convict the President on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.<ref>{{cite news |title=How senators voted on Trump’s impeachment|url=https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/trump-impeachment-vote-count-senate-results/ |work=[[Politico]] |date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>
