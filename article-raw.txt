'''Edward Colston''' (2 November 1636 – 11 October 1721) was an English merchant, [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trader]], [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] Member of Parliament, and [[philanthropist]]. Born in [[Bristol]] to a family of merchants that had lived in the city since the 1340s, he became a merchant, initially trading in wine, fruits and cloth, mainly in Spain, Portugal and other European ports. By 1680 he had become heavily involved in the slave trade, and in 1680 he became a member of the [[Royal African Company]], which held a [[monopoly]] of the British trade in African slaves. He became Deputy Governor, the highest office of the company, in 1689. It is uncertain exactly how much of his wealth stemmed from the slave trade, though there is no doubt that he was heavily involved with it.<ref>{{cite web

Colston used his wealth to support and endow schools, hospitals, almshouses and churches in Bristol, London and elsewhere. His name is commemorated by several Bristol landmarks, streets, schools and the [[Colston bun]]. Charitable foundations inspired by ones he founded still survive.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.dolphin-society.org.uk/history|title=Edward Colston, the Dolphin Society and 268 years of letter-writing…History / Background|date=2015-05-16|work=The Dolphin Society|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}</ref>

==Early life==
Colston was born on 2 November 1636 in Church Street, [[Bristol]], the eldest of at least 11 and possibly as many as 15 children. His parents were William Colston (born 1608; died 1681), a prosperous merchant who was [[High Sheriff of Bristol]] in 1643, and his wife Sarah (born 1608; died 1701), daughter of Edward Batten. He was brought up in Bristol until the time of the [[English Civil War]], when he probably lived for a while on his father's estate in [[Winterbourne, South Gloucestershire|Winterbourne]], just north of the city. The family then moved to London where Edward may have been a pupil at [[Christ's Hospital]] school.<ref name="ODNB">{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5996 |title=Colston, Edward |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |last=Morgan |first=Kenneth |date=September 2004 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/5996 |accessdate=14 August 2010}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref>

==Career==
Colston was apprenticed to the [[Mercers Company]] for eight years and by 1672 was shipping goods from London. He built up a lucrative business, trading cloth, oil, wine, sherry and fruit with [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]] and [[Africa]].

In 1680, Colston became a member of the [[Royal African Company]], which had held the monopoly in [[Kingdom of England|England]] on trading along the [[West Africa|west coast of Africa]] in [[gold]], [[silver]], [[ivory]] and [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]] from 1662.<ref name="ODNB" /> Colston rose rapidly on to the board of the company and became deputy governor, the company's most senior executive position, from 1689 to 1690; his association with the company ended in 1692.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/colston-edward-ii-1636-1721|title=COLSTON, Edward II (1636–1721), of Mortlake, Surr. {{!}} History of Parliament Online|website=www.historyofparliamentonline.org|access-date=16 November 2016}}</ref> This company had been set up by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and his brother the [[James II of England|Duke of York]] (later King James II), who was the governor of the company, together with [[City of London]] merchants, and it had many notable investors, including [[John Locke]], English philosopher and physician, widely regarded as one of the most influential of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers and commonly known as the "Father of Liberalism" (though he later changed his stance on the slave trade), and the diarist [[Samuel Pepys]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/restoration-18th-century-literature/articles/britains-involvement-with-new-world-slavery-and-the-transatlantic-slave-trade|title=Britain's involvement with New World slavery and the transatlantic slave trade|website=The British Library|language=en|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The sugar barons: family, corruption, empire, and war in the West Indies|last=Matthew.|first=Parker|date=2011|publisher=Walker & Co|isbn=9780802717443|location=New York|pages=126|oclc=682894539}}</ref>

During Colston's involvement with the [[Royal African Company]] (1680 to 1692), it is estimated that the company transported around 84,000 African men, women and children, who had been traded as slaves in [[West Africa]], of whom 19,000 died on their journey to the [[Caribbean]] and the rest of the Americas.<ref>{{subst:Citation needed}}</ref>&nbsp;Due to the conditions on many of the vessels, the extended journeys affected the ship's crew [[mortality rate]]s which were often similar and sometimes greater than the mortality rates amongst the slaves.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/atlanticslavetra0000curt/page/282|title=The Atlantic slave trade: a census|last=Curtin|first=Philip D.|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1969|isbn=0299054004|location=Madison|pages=[https://archive.org/details/atlanticslavetra0000curt/page/282 282–286]|oclc=46413}}</ref> The slaves were sold to planters for cheap labour on their [[Plantation economy|tobacco]], and, increasingly, [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantations]], who considered Africans would be more suited to the conditions than their own countrymen, as the climate resembled the climate of their homeland in [[West Africa]]. Enslaved Africans were also much less expensive to maintain than [[indentured servants]] or paid [[wage labour]]ers from Britain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/archaeology/caribbean/|title=Slavery in the Caribbean - International Slavery Museum, Liverpool museums|website=www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-19}}</ref>

Colston's parents had resettled in Bristol and in 1682 he made a loan to the [[Bristol Corporation]], the following year becoming a member of the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] and a [[burgess (title)|burgess]] of the City. In 1684 he inherited his brother's mercantile business in Small Street, and was a partner in a sugar refinery in St Peter's Churchyard, shipping sugar produced by slaves from [[St Kitts]]. However, Colston was never resident in Bristol as an adult, carrying on his London business from [[Mortlake]] in Surrey until he retired in 1708.<ref name="ODNB" />

The proportion of his wealth that came from his involvement in the slave trade and slave-produced sugar is unknown, and can only be the subject of conjecture unless further evidence is unearthed. As well as this income, he made money from his trade in the normal commodities mentioned above, interest from [[money lending]], and, most likely, from other careful financial dealings.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Edward Colston and Bristol|last=Morgan|first=Kenneth|publisher=Bristol Branch of the Historical Association|year=1999|isbn=|location=Bristol|pages=3|url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/bristolrecordsociety/publications/bha096.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200608093149/http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/bristolrecordsociety/publications/bha096.pdf|archive-date=8 June 2020|url-status=live|quote=To what extent Colston received money from the sale of slaves in the New World is unknown. He was undoubtedly remunerated for his work on the committees of the Royal African Company, but whether this money was the basis of his fortune remains conjectural. It is feasible that he accrued most of his wealth from the normal commodity trades with Europe mentioned above, which he had conducted successfully for several years before his involvement with the Royal African Company. Colston had inherited a modest legacy from his father, but this was insufficient to account for his own wealth. It is likely that he made profits out of careful financial dealings and accumulating savings, and he certainly gained income through money lending. […] It is likely that he made shrewd investments to augment his capital, but he has left no personal papers and so it is impossible to estimate, even roughly, what proportion of his wealth was gained from different business and financial ventures.}}</ref>

==Altruism and politics==
[[File:CromwellHouseMortlake.jpg|thumb|right|Cromwell House, [[Mortlake]], where Colston died in 1721]]
Colston supported and endowed schools, almshouses, hospitals and churches in Bristol, London and elsewhere. Many of his charitable foundations survive to this day.<ref name=":0" />

In Bristol, he founded [[almshouse]]s in King Street and [[Colstons Almshouses]] on St Michael's Hill, endowed [[Queen Elizabeth's Hospital]] school and helped found [[Colston's School|Colston's Hospital]], a boarding school which opened in 1710 leaving an endowment to be managed by the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] for its upkeep. He gave money to schools in Temple (one of which went on to become [[St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School]]) and other parts of Bristol, and to several churches and the cathedral. He was a strong [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] and [[High church|high-churchman]], and was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol]] in 1710 for just one parliament.<ref name="ODNB" />

[[David Hughson]] writing in 1808 described Colston as "the great benefactor of the city of Bristol, who, in his lifetime, expended more than 70,000L. [£] in charitable institutions".<ref name="hughson">{{cite book |last=Hughson |first=David |title=London; Being An Accurate History And Description of the British Metropolis And Its Neighbourhood, To Thirty Miles Extent, From An Actual Perambulation |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g8wAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA386 |volume=V |year=1808 |publisher=J Stratford |location=Holborn Hill, London |page=386 |chapter=Circuit of London}}</ref>

At the age of 84, Colston died on 11 October 1721 at his home, (old) Cromwell House (demolished 1857), in Mortlake. In his will he wished to be buried simply without pomp, but this instruction was ignored.<ref> Edward Colston Will, National archives Wills Online </ref> His body was carried to Bristol and was buried at [[All Saints' Church, Bristol|All Saints' Church]].

==Modern reappraisal==
In recent decades,{{when}} with increasing recognition of Colston's role in the slave trade, there has been growing criticism of the commemoration of Colston in Bristol.<ref name="Wilkins 1920">{{Cite book|title=Edward Colston (1636–1721 A.D.), a chronological account of his life and work|last=Wilkins|first=H.

Colston's name permeates the city in such landmarks as [[Colstons Almshouses]], [[Colston Tower]], [[Colston Hall]], Colston Avenue, Colston Street, [[Colston's Girls' School]], [[Colston's School]], Colston's Primary School (until 2018) and Temple Colston School (now part of [[St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School]]). He is also remembered, particularly by some schools, charities and the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]], on Colston Day (13 November), which celebrates the granting of a royal charter to the Society of Merchant Venturers in 1639, at a church service now at [[St Stephen's Church, Bristol|St Stephen's Church]].
