==Early life and education==
Harris was born in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]]. She is the daughter of a [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[India]]n mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer specialist, who immigrated to the United States from [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], India in 1960, and a [[Jamaican American]] father, [[Stanford University]] economics professor Donald Harris.

Harris attended the [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically African American college]] [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and received a [[Juris Doctor]] (JD) from [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]] in 1989. She is a member of [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] sorority.

==Career==
Harris served as Deputy District Attorney in [[Alameda County, California]] from 1990 to 1998. She then became Managing Attorney of the Career Criminal Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office.  In 2000, San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne recruited Harris to join her office, where she was Chief of the Community and Neighborhood Division, which oversees civil [[code enforcement]] matters.<ref>[http://www.womensradio.com/articles/This-DA-Makes-a-Difference-for-Women/559.html Women's Radio: This DA Makes a Difference For Women]</ref> The ''[[The Daily Journal Corporation|Los Angeles Daily Journal]]'' recognized Harris as one of the top 100 lawyers in California. Additionally, she has served on the boards of several community organizations.

Harris ran unopposed for re-election in 2007. She has claimed to have increased conviction rates over her predecessor. She has been called a front-runner in her campaign for [[Attorney General of California]] in 2010,<ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24604_Page3.html Politico: Ones to Watch Outside of the Beltway]</ref> and on June 8, 2010, she received the Democratic nomination for California Attorney General.<ref>http://www.kcbs.com/bayareanews/Harris-Wins-Nomination-in-Attorney-General-Race/7425210</ref> 

In 2009, Harris wrote ''Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor's Plan to Make Us Safer.''<ref>[http://blogcritics.org/books/article/book-review-smart-on-crime-by1/ Book Review of Smart on Crime]</ref> Harris looks at [[criminal justice]] from an economic perspective, attempting to reduce temptation and access for criminals.<ref name="HPQA">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kimberly-marteau-emerson/san-francisco-da-kamala-h_b_369505.html Huffington Post: Kimberly Marteau Emerson: Smart on Crime Q&A]</ref> The book goes through a series of "myths" surrounding the criminal justice system, and presents proposals to reduce and prevent crime.<ref name="HPQA" />

She has been outspoken on the need for innovation in public safety, particularly with respect to reducing the [[recidivism]] rate in San Francisco.<ref>[http://www.sfdistrictattorney.org/page.asp?id=49 San Francisco District Attorney - Reentry]</ref> One such program, "Back on Track" was signed into law by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as a model program for the state.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kamala-d-harris/finding-the-path-back-on_b_350679.html Huffington Post: Kamala Harris: Finding the Path Back on Track]</ref> Initially, there were issues with removing illegal immigrants from the program, including an incident involving Alexander Izaguire, who was later arrested for assault.<ref name="latimes.com" />  However, before the program was named a state model by Governor Schwarzenegger,<ref>[http://www.sfexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/under-the-dome/DAs-pet-project-is-now-statewide-example-64311037.html District Attorney program is now statewide example]</ref> it was revised to address this concern.

====Death penalty====
Harris is personally opposed to the death penalty, but has said that she would review each case individually.<ref name="sfbg.com">[http://www.sfbg.com/blogs/politics/2009/09/give_kamala_harris_credit_for.html San Francisco Bay Guardian - Give Kamala Harris Credit for Intregrity]</ref> Her position was tested in April 2004, when police officer Isaac Espinoza was murdered in the Bayview district. Harris announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing. The decision sparked protests from the police officers union, Sen. [[Diane Feinstein]], and others.  Those who supported the decision not to seek the death penalty included actor [[Mike Farrell]], San Francisco Supervisors [[Tom Ammiano]] and [[Sophie Maxwell]], in whose Bayview district the murder occurred.<ref>[http://www.basetree.com/photos/sets/photography39.html Basetree - Don't Kill in Our Name, Rally to Support Kamala Harris]</ref>  The jury found the convicted killer, David Hill, guilty of only second degree murder despite the prosecutor, Harry Dorfman, seeking a first degree murder conviction.<ref name="SF Sentinel">[http://www.sanfranciscosentinel.com/?p=1353 Police Officer Isaac Espinoza killer gets two consecutive life sentences — No possibility of parole]</ref> The defense argued that Hill thought Espinoza was a member of a rival gang attacking his territory and was able to persuade the jury that the murder was not premeditated. Hill was given the maximum sentence for the conviction, life without the possibility of parole.<ref name="SF Sentinel" />

Harris' position against the death penalty was tested again in the case of [[Edwin Ramos]], an [[illegal immigrant]] and alleged [[MS-13]] gang member who was accused of murdering Tony Bologna and his sons Michael and Matthew.<ref name="latimes.com">Finnegan, Michael. [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-harris22-2009jun22,0,3668981,full.story "San Francisco D.A.'s program trained illegal immigrants for jobs they couldn't legally hold"], ''Los Angeles Times'', June 22, 2009.</ref> Ramos was arrested just a month earlier with a gun that had been used in a murder, but the DA's office had declined to press charges. On September 10, 2009 Harris announced she would seek "life in prison without the possibility of parole," rather than the death penalty in the Ramos case.<ref name="The San Francisco Chronicle">Van Derbeken, Jaxon. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/11/BAM819L7NE.DTL "Edwin Ramos won't face death penalty"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', September 11, 2009.</ref> A judge has recently dismissed a lawsuit by the family against the city of San Francisco that claims the city contributed to the deaths of Danielle Bologna’s husband, Anthony Bologna, and two of their sons, through its sanctuary city policy.<ref name="The San Francisco Examiner lawsuit drop">[http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Judge-dismisses-Bologna-family-lawsuit-against-SF-85227152.html Judge dismisses Bologna family lawsuit against SF]</ref>

Harris believes that life without possibility of parole is a more efficient, and cost effective, punishment.<ref name="CA Capitol">[http://californiascapitol.com/blog/?p=341 San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris]</ref> According to the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, the death penalty conservatively costs $137 million per year.<ref name="CCAFJ report">[http://www.ccfaj.org/documents/CCFAJFinalReport.pdf California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice report]</ref> If the system were changed to life without possibility of parole, the annual costs would be approximately twelve million dollars.<ref name="CCAFJ report" /> Harris noted that the savings could put 1,000 more police officers into service.<ref name="CA Capitol" />

====Violent crimes, felons and conviction rate====
As San Francisco District Attorney, Harris has raised the overall felony conviction rate from 52% in 2003 to 67% in 2006, the highest in a decade, secured an 85% conviction rate for homicides, and increased convictions of drug dealers from 56% in 2003 to 74% in 2006.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/34 "Convicting Felons"]</ref>  While these statistics represent only trial convictions, she has also closed many cases via plea bargains.  When she took office, she took a special interest in clearing some of the murder caseload from the previous administration.  Harris claimed that the records were less than optimal from the previous administration, and worked to get convictions on what she could. That meant that out of the 73 Homicide case backlog 32 cases took deals for lesser charges such as manslaughter or took pleas to other crimes such as assault or burglary.<ref>Van Derbeken, Jaxon. [http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-03-20/news/17287759_1_conviction-handling-of-criminal-cases-homicide/4 "Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', March 20, 2006, p. 4.</ref>

However, in 2009 San Francisco prosecutors won a lower percentage of their felony jury trials than their counterparts at district attorneys' offices covering the 10 largest cities in California, according to data on case outcomes compiled by officials at the San Francisco Superior Court as well as by other county courts and prosecutors. (Officials in Sacramento, the state's seventh-largest city, did not provide data.) Harris' at-trial felony conviction rate that year was 76 percent, down 12 points from the previous year. By contrast, the most recent recorded statewide average was 83 percent, according to statistics from the California Judicial Council.<ref name="Lack of Conviction">Jamison, Peter. [http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-05-05/news/a-lack-of-conviction/ "A Lack of Conviction"], ''SF Weekly'', May 5, 2010.</ref> In a small sample, a report computed that the conviction rate for felony trials in San Francisco County in the first three months of 2010 was just 53%.<ref name="Lack of Conviction" /> San Francisco has historically had one of the lowest conviction rates in the state; the county is known for a defendant friendly jury pool.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=LJX3Ql7bu2YC&pg=PA960&lpg=PA960&dq=%22San+Francisco%22+%22low+conviction+rates%22&source=bl&ots=HXTEnRYxEn&sig=vmg9v_NFzcZvGAWjVEmv7-3m-FM&hl=en&ei=5LIGTKO7Ko_8NcqY2MYJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22San%20Francisco%22%20%22low%20conviction%20rates%22&f=false Encyclopedia of crime and punishment, Volume 1 By David Levinson]</ref><ref name="sfweekly.com">{{cite web|author=Peter Jamison |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-05-05/news/a-lack-of-conviction/ |title=A Lack of Conviction - Page 1 - News - San Francisco |publisher=SF Weekly |date=2010-05-05 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref> 

While police have credited Harris with tightening loopholes in bail and drug programs that defendants exploit, they have also accused her of being slow to prosecute murder suspects.<ref>Van Derbeken, Jaxon. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/03/20/MNG01HQVPA1.DTL#ixzz0jKyN3hF9 "Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', March 20, 2006.</ref> She has prosecuted gun crimes and gang violence with much success. She increased the number of gun cases taken to trial and doubled the conviction rate in felony gun trials, from 43% in 2003 to 90% in 2006 and has put 216 gang members behind bars.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/107 "Guns and Gang Violence"]</ref>

Harris has also taken a hard-line stance against perpetrators of gender-based violence, human trafficking, sex offenses, child assault, and domestic violence. She co-Sponsored the California Trafficking Victims Protection Act, created a Child Assault Unit in the District Attorney's Office,  raised the conviction rate in domestic violence trials, increased prison time for sex offenses against children, and led the creation efforts for San Francisco's first Safe House for sexually exploited youth.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/111 "Child Assault and Domestic Violence"]</ref><ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/110 "Human Trafficking and Sex Offenses"]</ref>

====Civil rights====
Harris has created a special Hate Crimes Unit as San Francisco District Attorney. She has focused on hate crimes against [[LGBT]] children and teens in schools. She convened a national conference to confront the "gay-transgender panic defense", which has been used to justify violent hate crimes.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/113 "Hate Crimes and Protecting Victims"]</ref> Harris supports same-sex marriage in California and opposed both [[Proposition 22]] and [[Proposition 8]].<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/MarriageEquality "Marriage Equality"]</ref>

In 2004, The [[National Urban League]] honored Harris as a "Woman of Power" and she received the [[Thurgood Marshall#Thurgood Marshall Award|Thurgood Marshall Award]] from the National Black Prosecutors Association in 2005. In her campaign for California Attorney General, she has received the endorsements of numerous groups, including the abortion rights [[EMILY's List]], California Legislative Black Caucus, Asian American Action Fund, Black Women Organized for Political Action, Mexican American Bar Association, South Asians for Opportunity, and the National Women's Political Caucus.<ref name="Endorsements">[http://kamalaharris.org/endorsements "Endorsements"]</ref>

====Education====
In interviews with [[Matt Lauer]] on ''[[The Today Show]]'' and local [[KGO-TV]], Harris argued for treating "habitually and chronic truancy" among children in elementary school as a crime committed by the parents of truant children. She argues that there is a direct connection between habitual truancy in elementary school and crime later in life.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i0tpAqrDDY "KGO/ABC 7's View from the Bay's Interview with Kamala Harris on Truancy Rates"]</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-c-4FlgUT0 "Kamala Harris on the Today Show"]</ref> She has received the endorsement of the California Federation of Teachers.<ref name="Endorsements" />

====Labor endorsements====
In her campaign for California Attorney General, Harris has received the endorsements of [[United Farm Workers]] co-founder [[Dolores Huerta]], United Educators of San Francisco, and the San Francisco Firefighters Local 798.<ref name="Endorsements" />

====Environment====
During her time as San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created the Environmental Justice Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office and has prosecuted several industries and individuals for pollution, most notably [[U-Haul]], Alameda Publishing Corporation, and the [[Cosco Busan oil spill]]. She has also advocated for strong enforcement of environmental protection laws.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/613 "Protecting the Environment"]</ref>

==== Financial crimes ====
Harris has prosecuted numerous financial crimes throughout her career, particularly those affecting elders, high-tech crime, and identity theft.<ref>[http://kamalaharris.org/issues/594 "Prosecuting Financial Crimes"]</ref>

==== Police department laboratory and disclosure failures ====
San Francisco Police Department drug lab technician Deborah Madden admitted to taking amounts of [[cocaine]] from evidence samples in the police department's crime lab. The testing unit of the police department lab was shut down on March 9, 2010. Since then, hundreds of drug cases have either been dismissed or discharged due to evidentiary requirements. While Harris' office was aware of troubling issues at the police department's drug lab months before the issue became public, and even before the police chief was apprised of the situation, the entire scope of the issues did not become clear until Madden was exposed for removing drug samples.<ref>{{cite web|author=8:21 PDT |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/SFPD-drug-lab-technician-issues-not-addressed-90907184.html#ixzz0nkuMJLsz |title=Drug lab technician issues not addressed &#124; San Francisco Examiner |publisher=Sfexaminer.com |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref> The police department later widened the investigation into their crime lab to include cases that were already prosecuted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-04-03/news/20833423_1_drug-lab-crime-lab-drug-cases |title=Kamala Harris faces tough questions in race - SFGate |publisher=Articles.sfgate.com |date=2010-04-03 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>

On May 4, 2010, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported that a number of felony convictions were in jeopardy when it was revealed that the prosecuting attorneys did not disclose criminal backgrounds for relevant San Francisco police officers before testifying.<ref name="articles.sfgate.com">{{cite web|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-05-04/news/20883129_1_police-officers-cocaine-cases-police-disciplinary-cases |title=S.F. cops' pasts could jeopardize convictions - SFGate |publisher=Articles.sfgate.com |date=2010-05-04 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>  On May 20, 2010, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo ruled that prosecutors had violated defendants' rights by hiding damaging information about the police drug lab technician. The judge concluded that prosecutors had failed to fulfill their constitutional duty to tell defense attorneys about problems surrounding Deborah Madden, the now-retired technician at the heart of the cocaine-skimming scandal that led police to shut down the drug analysis section of their crime lab. Harris' office has been unable to vouch for the reliability of Madden's work and has dismissed more than 600 drug cases since the scandal became public in February. Madden testified at trials before leaving the lab in December. Under a 1963 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling, ''[[Brady v. Maryland]]'', district attorneys are obligated to provide defense attorneys with information in their possession about prosecution witnesses that could be used to challenge their credibility.
 
Massullo wrote that top drug prosecutor Assistant District Attorney Sharon Woo's November 19 memo about Madden to Russ Giuntini, Chief Assistant District Attorney, and Jeffrey Ross, head of the criminal division, showed that prosecutors "at the highest levels of the district attorney's office knew that Madden was not a dependable witness at trial and that there were serious concerns regarding the crime lab".<ref>{{cite web|author=8:21 PDT |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/SFPD-drug-lab-technician-issues-not-addressed-90907184.html#ixzz0pl0VitGe |title=Drug lab technician issues not addressed &#124; San Francisco Examiner |publisher=Sfexaminer.com |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref> The failure by Harris' office "to produce information actually in its possession regarding Madden and the crime lab is a violation of the defendants' constitutional rights", Massullo wrote. The Judge said that the prosecutors had the "duty to implement some type of procedure to secure and produce information relevant to Madden's criminal history." But Massullo said her repeated requests that prosecutors explain why they did not have such procedures were met with "a level of indifference". However, Judge Massullo refused to dismiss any cases, saying that all cases must be considered individually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/05/21/BAN01DHVMU.DTL#ixzz0od05q8Qb |title=Judge rips Harris' office for hiding problems |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>

On May 26, 2010, the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' reported that a San Francisco coroner's supervising toxicologist, Ann Marie Gordon, vouched for blood-test results in drunken-driving cases for two years before prosecutors told defense attorneys that a Washington state court had labeled her as a "perpetrator of fraud" while running that state's toxicology lab. San Francisco prosecutors began telling defense attorneys about Gordon's past after the ''Chronicle'' reported earlier in May 2010 that scores of police officers had criminal arrests or misconduct cases that were never called to defendants' attention before trials. Prosecutors are obligated to provide potentially exculpatory information about their witnesses to the defense under the 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/05/26/MNJP1DJPEN.DTL#ixzz0pAuhDNOD |title=Problems of S.F. toxicologist not disclosed |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>
