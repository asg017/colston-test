'''Edward Colston''' (2 November 1636 – 11 October 1721) was a [[Bristol]]-born English merchant, [[philanthropist]], [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trader]], and Member of Parliament. He supported and endowed schools, almshouses, hospitals and churches in Bristol, London and elsewhere, and his name is commemorated in several Bristol landmarks, streets, three schools and the [[Colston bun]]. Many of his charitable foundations survive to this day.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.dolphin-society.org.uk/history|title=Edward Colston, the Dolphin Society and 268 years of letter-writing…History / Background|date=2015-05-16|work=The Dolphin Society|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}</ref> A significant part of his wealth was acquired through the trade and exploitation of slaves.<ref>{{cite web

==Early life==
Colston was born on 2 November 1636 in Church Street, [[Bristol]], the youngest of at least 15 children. His parents were William Colston (died 1681), a prosperous merchant who was [[High Sheriff of Bristol]] in 1643, and his wife Sarah (died 1701), daughter of Edward Batten. He was brought up in [[Bristol]] until the time of the [[English Civil War]], when he probably lived for a while on his father's estate in [[Winterbourne, South Gloucestershire|Winterbourne]], just north of the city. The family then moved to London where Edward may have been a pupil at [[Christ's Hospital]] school.<ref name="ODNB">{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5996 |title=Colston, Edward |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |last=Morgan |first=Kenneth |date=September 2004 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/5996 |accessdate=14 August 2010}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref>

==Career==
He was apprenticed to the [[Mercers Company]] for eight years and by 1672 was shipping goods from London. He built up a lucrative business, trading cloth, oil, wine, sherry and fruit with [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]] and [[Africa]]. 

In 1680, Colston became a member of the [[Royal African Company]], which had held the monopoly in [[Kingdom of England|England]] on trading along the west coast of [[Africa]] in [[gold]], [[silver]], [[ivory]] and [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]] from 1662.<ref name="ODNB" /> Colston rose rapidly on to the board of the company and was Deputy Governor, its most senior executive position, from 1689 to 1690; his association with the company ended in 1692.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/colston-edward-ii-1636-1721|title=COLSTON, Edward II (1636–1721), of Mortlake, Surr. {{!}} History of Parliament Online|website=www.historyofparliamentonline.org|access-date=16 November 2016}}</ref> This company had been set up by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and his brother [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], (later King James II, who was the Governor of the company), together with [[City of London]] merchants, and it had many notable investors, including [[John Locke]], English philosopher and physician, widely regarded as one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers and commonly known as the "Father of Liberalism".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/restoration-18th-century-literature/articles/britains-involvement-with-new-world-slavery-and-the-transatlantic-slave-trade|title=Britain’s involvement with New World slavery and the transatlantic slave trade|website=The British Library|language=en|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref>

During the time of Colston’s involvement with the Royal African company, 1680 to 1692, it is estimated that the company transported  around 84,000 African men, women and children, who had been traded as slaves in West Africa, of whom 19,000 died on their way to the Caribbean and the Americas. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.slavevoyages.org/voyage/|title=Voyages Database|website=www.slavevoyages.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}</ref> Ship’s crew mortality rates were often similar and sometimes greater than the mortality rates amongst the slaves.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46413|title=The Atlantic slave trade: a census,|last=Curtin|first=Philip D.|date=|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1969|isbn=0299054004|location=Madison,|pages=282-286|oclc=46413}}</ref> 

His parents had resettled in [[Bristol]] and in 1682 he made a loan to the [[Bristol Corporation|Corporation]], the following year becoming a member of the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] and a [[burgess (title)|burgess]] of the City. In 1684 he inherited his brother's mercantile business in Small Street, and was a partner in a sugar refinery in St. Peter's Churchyard, shipping sugar produced by slaves from [[St. Kitts]]. But he was never resident in [[Bristol]], carrying on his London business from [[Mortlake]] in Surrey until he retired in 1708.<ref name="ODNB" />

The proportion of his wealth that came from his involvement in the slave trade and slave-produced sugar is unknown, and can only be the subject of conjecture unless further evidence is unearthed.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Edward Colston and Bristol|last=Morgan|first=Kenneth|publisher=Bristol Branch of the Historical Association|year=1999|isbn=|location=Bristol|pages=3}}</ref>  As well as this income, he made money from his trade in the normal commodities mentioned above, interest from money lending, and, most likely, from other careful financial dealings.<ref name=":1" />

==Altruism and politics==
[[File:CromwellHouseMortlake.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Cromwell House, [[Mortlake]], where Colston died in 1721]]
He supported and endowed schools, almshouses, hospitals and churches in Bristol, London and elsewhere. Many of his charitable foundations survive to this day.<ref name=":0" />

In [[Bristol]], he founded [[almshouse]]s in King Street and on [[St Michael on the Mount Without|St Michael's Hill]], endowed [[Queen Elizabeth's Hospital]] school and helped found [[Colston's School|Colston's Hospital]], a boarding school which opened in 1710 leaving an endowment to be managed by the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] for its upkeep. He gave money to schools in Temple (one of which went on to become [[St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School]]) and other parts of Bristol, and to several churches and the cathedral. He was a strong [[Tory]] and [[High church|high-churchman]], and was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol]] in 1710 for just one parliament.<ref name="ODNB" />

David Hughson writing in 1808 described Colston:
<blockquote>[Cromwell House was certainly the residence, in the last century, of] that excellent man Edward Colston, Esq. the great benefactor of the city of Bristol, who, in his lifetime, expended more than 10,000L. [£] in charitable institutions.''<ref name="hughson">{{cite book |last=Hughson |first=David |title=London; Being An Accurate History And Description of the British Metropolis And Its Neighbourhood, To Thirty Miles Extent, From An Actual Perambulation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g8wAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA386 |volume=V |year=1808 |publisher=J Stratford |location=Holborn Hill, London |page=386 |chapter=Circuit of London}}</ref></blockquote>

==Death==
He died on 11 October 1721 at his home, (old) Cromwell House (demolished 1857), in Mortlake. His body was carried back to [[Bristol]] and was buried at [[All Saints, Bristol|All Saints' Church]]. His tomb was designed by [[James Gibbs]]. He died at the age of 84.<ref>{{cite web |title=Church of All Saints  |work=Images of England |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379381 |accessdate=16 March 2003}}</ref>

==Modern reappraisal==
[[Image:Edward Colston 1895 statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of Edward Colston in [[The Centre, Bristol]]]]
A statue, designed by [[John Cassidy (artist)|John Cassidy]], was erected in the centre of [[Bristol]] in 1895 to commemorate Colston's great philanthropy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Edward Colston |work=PMSA National Recording Project |url=http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/BL/BR09.htm |accessdate=9 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109153705/http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/BL/BR09.htm |archivedate=9 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1998, however, "someone scrawled on its base the name of one of the professions in which he made his fortune: SLAVE TRADER." <ref>{{cite book|last=Hochschild|first=Adam|title=Bury the Chains|year=2006|publisher=Mariner Books|location=New York City|pages=15}}</ref> He is a divisive figure in Bristolian civil society, viewed by some as an inspirational figure for the city, due to his donations of money to schools and other causes, but, in more recent times as Colston's activities as a major [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trader]] emerged <ref>{{Cite book|title=Edward Colston [1636-1721 A.D.] A chronological account of his life and work.|last=Wilkins|first=H.

Some have called for his statue to be taken down. In a poll in the local newspaper, the ''[[Bristol Post]]'', in 2014 just over half (56 per cent) of the 1,100 respondents said it should stay – 44 per cent wanted it to go.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bristol-torn-apart-over-statue-of-edward-colston-but-is-this-a-figure-of-shame-or-a-necessary-9555333.html|title=Bristol: Calls for statue of Edward Colston to be torn down|date=22 June 2014|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=16 November 2016}}</ref> Others called for a memorial plaque honouring the victims of [[Atlantic slave trade|slavery]] to be fitted to his statue. Bristol's first elected mayor, [[George Ferguson (architect)|George Ferguson]], stated on Twitter in 2013 that "Celebrations for Colston are perverse, not something I shall be taking part in!".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/bristol-mayor-city-s-celebration-edward-colston/story-19729958-detail/story.html|title=Bristol mayor: City's celebration of Edward Colston is|date=30 August 2013|newspaper=Bristol Post|access-date=16 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904091019/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-mayor-City-s-celebration-Edward-Colston/story-19729958-detail/story.html|archivedate=4 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In July 2018, [[Bristol City Council]], which is responsible for the statue, made a planning application to add a second plaque which would "add to the public knowledge about Colston", including his [[philanthropy]] and his involvement in [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trading]], though the initial wording suggested came in for significant criticism and re-wording is taking place.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/wording-second-plaque-proposed-edward-1810137|title=The second plaque planned for Colston statue linking him to 20,000 deaths|last=Cork|first=Tristan|date=2018-07-22|work=bristolpost|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/theft-vandalism-second-colston-statue-1815967|title=Theft of second Colston plaque 'may be justified' says councillor|last=Cork|first=Tristan|date=2018-07-23|work=bristolpost|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/row-breaks-out-merchant-venturer-1925896|title=Row breaks out over wording of Edward Colston statue plaque|last=Cork|first=Tristan|date=2018-08-23|work=bristolpost|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref>

Colston's name permeates the city in such landmarks as [[Colston Tower]], [[Colston Hall]], Colston Avenue, Colston Street, [[Colston's Girls' School]], [[Colston's School]], Colston's Primary School and Temple Colston School (now part of [[St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School|St Mary Redcliffe & Temple School]]). He is also remembered, particularly by some schools, charities and the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]], on Colston's Day on 13 November, his birthday, at a church service now at [[St Stephen's Church, Bristol|St Stephen's Church]]. A regional bread bun, the [[Colston bun]], is named after him.<ref name="ODNB" /><ref>{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Alan |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-211579-9 |page=114}}</ref>

In April 2017, the charity that runs the [[Colston Hall]], the [https://www.colstonhall.org/about-us/bristol-music-trust/ Bristol Music Trust], announced that it will drop the name of Colston when it reopens after refurbishment in 2020.  There had been protests and petitions calling for a name change and some concertgoers and artists had [[Boycott|boycotted]] the venue because of the Colston name.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/26/bristol-colston-hall-to-drop-name-of-slave-trader-after-protests|title=Bristol's Colston Hall to drop name of slave trader after protests|date=26 April 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB}}</ref> Following the decision, petitions to retain the name of Colston reached almost 10,000 signatures, though the [https://www.colstonhall.org/about-us/bristol-music-trust/ Bristol Music Trust], the charity that runs the hall, confirmed that the name change would go ahead despite this support for the current name.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/colston-hall-will-not-going-56636|title=Petitions to stop Colston Hall name change reach 9k signatures|last=Ballinger|first=Alex|date=2017-05-12|work=bristolpost|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref>

In November 2017, after decades of debates, [[Colston's Girls' School]] announced that it was not going to drop the name of Colston because it was of “no benefit” to the school to do so.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/colstons-girls-school-not-want-717435|title=One of Bristol’s oldest schools is not changing its name|last=Yong|first=Michael|date=2017-11-02|work=bristolpost|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref>
