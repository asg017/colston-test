'''Edward Colston''' ([[2 November]] [[1636]] &ndash; [[11 October]] [[1721]]) was a [[Bristol]]-born [[England|English]] [[merchant]] and [[philanthropist]]. He is a controversial figure today as much of his wealth, although used often for generous purposes, was acquired throught the trade and exploitation of [[slaves]].

He was born [[2 November]] [[1636]] in Temple Street, [[Bristol]], the eldest of at least eleven children. His parents were William Colston, a prosperous merchant and Sarah n√©e Batten. He was brought up in Bristol until the time of the [[English Civil War]], when he probably lived for a while on his father&#8217;s estate in [[Winterbourne, South Gloucestershire|Winterbourne]], south [[Gloucestershire]]. The family then moved to [[London]] where Edward may have been a pupil at [[Christ's Hospital]].

He was apprenticed to the [[Mercers Company]] for eight years and by [[1672]] was shipping goods from London.  He built up a lucrative business, trading with [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]] and [[Africa]].
In [[1680]] Colston became a member of the [[Royal African Company]], which had held the monopoly in Britain on [[gold]], [[ivory]] and slave trading since [[1662]].  

His parents had resettled in Bristol and in [[1682]] he made a loan to the Corporation, the following year becoming a member of the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] and a [[burgess]] of the City. In [[1684]] he inherited his brother&#8217;s mercantile business in Small Street, and was a partner in a sugar refinery in St Peter&#8217;s Churchyard - shipping sugar from [[St Kitts]]. But he was never resident in Bristol, carrying on his London business from [[Mortlake]] in [[Surrey]] until he retired in [[1708]].

He founded [[almshouse]]s in King Street and on St Michaels Hill, he endowed [[Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s Hospital]] school and helped found Colston&#8217;s Boy&#8217;s School, which opened in [[1710]] leaving an endownment to be managed by the Society of Merchant Venturers for its upkeep. He gave money to schools in Temple and other parts of Bristol, and to several churches and the cathedral. 
He was a strong [[Tory]] and high-churchman, and was returned an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for Bristol in 1710 for just one parliament.

He died [[11 October]] [[1721]] at his home in Mortlake. His body was carried back to Bristol and was buried at All Saints Church.

==Colston and Bristol today==
A statue was erected in Bristol in [[1895]] commemorating Colston. He was widely viewed as an inspirational figure for the city, due to his donations of money to schools and other causes.  His name permeates the city in such landmarks as the Colston Tower, Colston Hall, Colston Hill and Colston's school.  He is also remembered, particularly in schools, by Colston's Day, on [[13 November]].

Colston is a controversial figure these days in Bristol. In the [[1990]]s, public knowledge of his participation in the slave trade grew. Bristol band [[Massive Attack]] refused to play at Colston Hall, and his statue has been repeatedly defaced and vandalised.
