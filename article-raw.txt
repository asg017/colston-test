==Early career==
{{Main|Electoral history of Kamala Harris}}
[[File:Kamala Harris 0.jpg|thumb|CA Attorney General's office]]
In 1990, Harris was hired as a deputy [[district attorney]] in [[Alameda County, California]] where she was noted as being "an able prosecutor on the way up."<ref name=Quits>{{cite news|author=Peter Hartlaub|title=Division Chief Quits DA's Office|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=3 Aug 2000}}</ref>  She specialized in child [[sexual abuse]] trials, which she observed were a difficult type of prosecution, given juries are more inclined to accept the word of an adult over the word of a child.<ref name=Karma/>

{{quote|"Harris has a good courtroom presence, a high success rate. She is a genuinely good person and her social values will work well in San Francisco."<ref name=Karma/>  –– Tom Orloff, ''Alameda District Attorney''}}

During this time, Harris also taught [[advocacy]] skills at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[University of San Francisco]].<ref name=WellPaid>{{cite news|author=Dan Morain|title=2 More Brown Associates Get Well-Paid Posts|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=29 Nov 1994}}</ref>

Harris dated then-California Assembly Speaker [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]] from 1994 to 1995.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=Zhou-190128>{{cite news | url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/28/18200885/willie-brown-kamala-harris-2020 | title=Willie Brown's op-ed about Kamala Harris, explained | work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] | date=January 28, 2019 | access-date=February 1, 2019 | first=Li | last=Zhou}}</ref><ref name=Launched/> Brown began introducing Harris to his political network, resulting in Harris being increasingly featured in local newspapers and [[Society reporting|society columns]]. According to Jack Davis, the manager of Brown's campaign for mayor of San Francisco, "'Brown [was] the darling of the well-to-do set... And she was the girlfriend, and so she met, you know, everybody who’s anybody, as a result of being his girl.'"<ref name=Launched>{{cite news|author=Michael Kruse|title=How San Francisco's Wealthiest Families Launched Kamala Harris|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/09/kamala-harris-2020-president-profile-san-francisco-elite-227611|publisher=Politico|date=9 Aug 2019}}</ref>

In 1994, Harris took leave of her position in Alameda County when Brown appointed her to the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board.<ref name=Cushy>{{cite news|author=Dan Walters|title=Political Connections Can Lead to Cushy jobs|publisher=North County Times|date=1 Dec 1994}}</ref><ref name=WellPaid/><ref name=Launched/>  The position paid $100,000 per year.<ref name=":9">{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=James|title=Willie Brown: A Biography|date=1996|publisher=University of California Press|pages=390, 394, 402, 404}}</ref> Harris served on the board for six months.

Harris ended her relationship with Brown shortly after his mayoral inauguration.<ref name=Karma/> In 2003, she expressed frustration at being linked to Brown in the media; referring to him as an "albatross hanging around my neck," she said, "I have no doubt that I am independent of him [Brown] –– and that he would probably ''right now'' express some ''fright'' about the ''fact'' that he cannot control me.  His career is over; I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing".<ref name=Karma/> In 2015 she referred to Brown as "a mentor and friend."<ref name= "Shape" />

In February 1998, [[San Francisco District Attorney's Office|San Francisco District Attorney]], Terence Hallinan, appointed Harris as an Assistant District Attorney.<ref name=Head>{{cite news|title=DA Names New Head of Career Crime Unit|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=3 Feb 1998}}</ref>  She became the chief of the Career Criminal Division, supervising five other attorneys,<ref name=Karma/> where she prosecuted [[homicide]], [[burglary]], [[robbery]] and [[sexual assault]] cases –– particularly [[Three-strikes law|Three-Strikes cases]].<ref name=Karma/>  Harris was noted as having been "an excellent mentor" in the office, and had been active in Hallinan's 1999 re-election campaign through his December election.  However, eight months later, Harris quit.<ref name=Quits/><ref name=Kayo>{{cite news|author=Fred Gardener|title=Kamala vs. Kayo (2003)|publisher=[[Anderson Valley Advertiser]]|date=13 Feb 2019}}</ref>

====Office turmoil====
Harris reportedly clashed with Hallinan's new chief assistant, Darrell Salomon –– a former personal attorney to [[Dianne Feinstein|Senator Dianne Feinstein]] with connections to City Hall, but no criminal prosecuting experience.<ref name=Quits/><ref name=TopAide>{{cite news|author=Peter Hartlaub|title=DA's top aide quits among turmoil|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=21 Aug 2000}}</ref> Salomon was appointed in January after the previous chief, Richard Iglehart, was appointed to become a Superior Court Judge.<ref name=Assistant>{{cite news|author=Peter Hartlaub|title=Hallinan picks City Hall insider as Assistant|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=13 Jan 2000}}</ref>

Salomon's appointment coincided with the introduction of a [[California ballot proposition|state ballot measure]] –– [[2000 California Proposition 21|Prop 21]] –– which would be voted on in an election held in three months.<ref name=Kayo/>  The proposition would grant prosecutors the option of trying [[Minor (law)|juvenile]] defendants in Superior Court rather than juvenile courts.  This authority was usually only granted to judges and could have had a big impact in San Francisco where drug violations accounted for nearly 70% of prosecuted crimes.<ref name=Kayo/>

Harris opposed the measure, as did Hallinan, who was the only District Attorney in the state to oppose the measure.<ref name=Kayo/>  However, Harris, concerned about the possibility of nearly 40,000 kids per year –– mostly [[Minority group#Involuntary minorities|minority]] –– being tried in adult court, became very involved in campaigning against the measure, including attending rallies as a speaker, writing position papers and volunteering for the "No-On-21" campaign on weekends.<ref name=Kayo/>  Her knowledge and commitment to the issue was such that the District Attorney's Public Information Officer at the time, Fred Gardner, would give reporters the option to interview both Harris and Hallinan.  However, doing so reportedly made Hallinan suspicious that Harris was trying to usurp him in preparation of challenging him for the next election (in 2003).<ref name=Kayo/>  Salomon approached Gardner and allegedly accused him of helping Harris:

{{quote|"You're trying to make a star out of Kamala Harris."<ref name=Kayo/>}}

Gardener dismissed the accusation, noting that "she [Harris] is already a star," and was then reportedly told by Salomon to stop directing Prop 21 media inquiries to Harris as he believed Harris had "an agenda" given she was "Willie Brown's protege."<ref name=Kayo/>

Gardener confronted Harris and inquired if she was planning to run in 2003. She reportedly replied that it would be "unprofessional" to run against Hallinan if he decided to run for a third term.<ref name=Kayo/> Gardener relayed Harris' response to Hallinan.  However, Gardner stated that Hallinan "did not believe her."<ref name=Kayo/>  Hallinan then ordered that all calls from reporters, not only those pertaining to Prop 21, go directly to him:

{{quote|"I'm the elected official.  I'm the D.A. It's my office. Except for my spokesman, I don't want anybody going to the media."<ref name=Kayo/>}}

Hallinan then reassigned Harris, which Harris believed to be a [[de facto]] demotion, and set a [[canary trap]] to test her loyalty, which she passed.<ref name=Kayo/>

Shortly after her reassignment, Harris was a part of a group of supervisors who confronted Hallinan about Salomon, seeking to "overthrow" him.<ref name=Karma/> However, when their attempt failed, Harris then filed a complaint against Salomon and quit.<ref name=Quits/><ref name=Karma/>

The spokesman for the District Attorney's office called Harris' defection "a sad day [because Harris was] a good lawyer, well-liked and brilliant."<ref name=Quits/>

Salomon resigned two weeks after Harris left.<ref name=TopAide/>  He reportedly blamed Harris for "stirring up resentment towards him."<ref name=Kayo/>

===City Attorney===
In August 2000, Harris took a new job at [[San Francisco City Hall]], working for elected [[City Attorney]], [[Louise Renne]].<ref name=Quits/> Renne hired Harris to take the place of Katherine Feinstein, after Feinstein was appointed as a [[Alameda County Superior Court|Superior Court Judge]].<ref name=Quits/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womensradio.com/articles/This-DA-Makes-a-Difference-for-Women/559.html |title=Women's Radio: This DA Makes a Difference For Women |publisher=Womensradio.com |accessdate=November 18, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219095441/http://www.womensradio.com/articles/This-DA-Makes-a-Difference-for-Women/559.html |archivedate=December 19, 2010}}</ref><ref name=Quits/>  Harris ran the Family and Children's Services Division representing child abuse and [[Child neglect|neglect]] cases, domestic violence, building code enforcement, and public health matters.<ref name=Karma/><ref name=Quits/>  Renne said of Harris:

===2003 Campaign for District Attorney===
====Campaign organization====
[[File:Congresswoman Pelosi meets San Francisco's District Attorney, Kamala Harris; March 30, 2004.jpg|thumb|Harris with Congresswoman [[Nancy Pelosi]], 2004]]
Harris was reportedly so angry about the discontent in Terence Hallinan's office that she decided to run against him.<ref name=Karma/>  She began "methodically gathering support" by attending political events, volunteering on other campaigns, assuming [[Board of directors|board memberships]] on nonprofits, being seen at exclusive parties, and presenting herself as an alternative to a "political has-been."<ref name=Karma/>

In mid-2002, Harris called Mark Buell, the stepfather of her friend, [[Walker family|Summer Tompkins Walker]], and told him of her intention to run for District Attorney against the two-term incumbent –– and her former boss.<ref name=Launched/>  Buell was married to major Democratic megadonor, [[Susie Tompkins Buell]].  He was doubtful of Harris' candidacy as he had only thought of her as "a socialite with a law degree"  However, Buell, impressed by Harris, offered to be her [[Political campaign staff|finance chair]].<ref name=Launched/>

Buell advised that to beat an incumbent, Harris would need to raise more than $150,000, the highest amount ever raised to campaign for the position.  He and Harris organized a finance committee composed mostly of Harris' friends, who were "young socialite ladies".<ref name=Launched/>  The committee included [[Getty family|Vanessa Getty]] and [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art#Elected Trustees|Susan Swig]].  While Harris, saying that the black community was "her base",<ref name=Karma/> set up her campaign office in [[Bayview–Hunters Point, San Francisco|Bayview]] –– the "most isolated neighborhood" in San Francisco<ref name=Launched/> –– the committee arranged for her to "routinely" raise money in the exclusive neighborhood of [[Pacific Heights, San Francisco|Pacific Heights]], with 25% of her donations coming from Pacific Heights alone:

{{quote|"The crowd seems fascinated by Harris, an intelligent woman of color who speaks their language, who knows their first names, and who understands that as ''liberals'', they want to maintain law and order –– but with a certain San Francisco­style [[noblesse oblige]]."<ref name=Karma/>}}

Harris was also seeking to run a campaign that disrupted negative [[Stereotypes of African Americans|stereotypes of black women]]:<ref name=Karma/>

{{quote|“...Black female candidates have to fight the perception that black women are not competent. When whites look at black women they see [them] as servants, maids or cooks...Being able to cross over into the white community is essential for any black, female or male, to succeed as a political figure. [They should] lay the groundwork by looking to become active on the boards of social, cultural and, charitable institutions like symphonies, museums, and hospitals. It’s the way to get respect from a world that otherwise is content to eschew or label you."<ref name=Basic>{{cite book|author=Willie Brown|title=Basic Brown: My Life and Our Times|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=53–54|year=2008}}</ref> –– Willie Brown}}

When Harris announced her candidacy, she had served on the board of trustees of the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco]], had been a member of [[SFJAZZ Center|San Francisco Jazz Organization]], was a patron dinner chair for the [[San Francisco Symphony|San Francisco Symphony's]] Black & White Ball, was the executive director of the San Francisco Domestic Violence Consortium, led the board of directors of Partners Ending Domestic Abuse, and was a board member of nonprofit, Women Count. Harris was also documented attending exclusive events, dressing in luxury clothing such as [[Burberry]], and dining with the heirs of billionaires:<ref name=Launched/>

{{quote|"...people wanted to be able to say they’d met her and were supporting her because of this quasi-social network that we started with, and the more she raised, and the more she got traction, the more everybody else wanted to say they heard her, they talked to her and were supportive...but they were kind of professional [[socialite]]s, and they wanted to help her. They saw it as a two-way street."<ref name=Launched/> –– Sharon Owsley, ''Socialite and Attorney''}}

In 2003, Harris entered the election, running against two-term incumbent and former boss, Terence Hallinan, and defense attorney, Bill Fazio.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Nina|title=Why Kamala Matters|url=http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/why-kamala-matters|accessdate=May 12, 2015|work=San Francisco Magazine|date=August 2007}}</ref><ref name=Continue>{{cite news|author=Alison Soltau|title=Panel rules DA candidate can continue spending|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=16 Oct 2003}}</ref>  Harris was the least known candidate among the three, but noted to be "whip-smart, hard-working, and well-credentialed."<ref name=Continue/><ref name=Karma/>

Hallinan and Fazio sought to [[Cronyism|link Harris to Willie Brown]], who was openly campaigning and fundraising for Harris, through a [[Political action committee|PAC]] –– California Voter Project –– though reportedly without her consent.<ref name=Karma>{{cite news|author=Peter Byrne|title=Kamala's Karma|publisher=San Francisco Weekly|date=24 Sep 2003|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/news/kamalas-karma/}}</ref>  Harris denied financially benefitting from Brown.  However, Mark Buell later admitted that he met with Brown for lunch and Brown volunteered a campaign tactic to him.<ref name=Karma/>  Buell also admitted that Brown personally donated $500 –– the individual donation maximum –– to Harris after [[Walker family|Summer Tompkins Walker]] reportedly asked Brown to donate while at a restaurant.<ref name=Karma/>

{{quote|"How can Harris root out corruption if she has Willie supporting her behind the scenes?  I do not care that they had a relationship, but there are legitimate questions whether or not there is payback there."<ref name=Karma/> –– Bill Fazio}}

However, Harris supporters said that statements used to tie her to Willie Brown were [[Misogyny|misogynistic]]. Harris' sister, Maya, asked: “When a woman dates an accomplished man, why are people so willing to assume it's only because of him that the woman is successful?" <ref name=Karma/>  Harris' mother stated:

{{quote|"What has Willie Brown done for her?  Introduce her to society people when they dated?  If they did not like Kamala on her own right, they would have dropped her after she dropped Willie.  Kamala is comfortable in all kinds of social scenes.  She can pull it off in [[High society (social class)|high society]], too. She has the manners, the eating habits."<ref name=Karma/>}}

Harris' campaign later successfully lobbied the 24-member [[California Democratic Party#County central committees|Central Committee]] –– including U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein and then-House Majority leader [[Nancy Pelosi]]  –– of the statewide Democratic party to deny their influential endorsement to either of Harris' competitors.<ref name=Karma/>  It was the first time the Central Committee had withheld its endorsement from an incumbent.

====Campaign spending violation====
[[File:Kamala Harris (5122897990).jpg|thumb|right|Rally at [[University of Southern California|USC]], 2010]]
Harris was found to be guilty, by the city's Ethics Commission, of violating campaign spending limit of $211,000, of which Harris had agreed to abide by before the campaign commenced.<ref name=Continue/>  Harris had overspent the pledged amount by nearly $100,000.  The Commission's own staff was later accused of abusing its discretion, and favoring Harris, when it retroactively lifted the campaign spending limit after Harris' campaign had spent over the limit, and when Harris' campaign said that it was recognizing the Commission as the authority of the limit's forms rather than the Department of Elections.<ref name=Continue/>  The Commission denied the accusations, saying that its staff acted with its authority under local law.<ref name=Continue/>

Harris' supporters said her campaign mistakenly violated the spending cap due to a "misinterpretation of confusing law changes" on the forms.<ref name=Continue/> They also argued that the cap put lesser-known candidates at a disadvantage, which was unfair since Harris had to spend more to increase her profile.  However, critics charged that the forms were straightforward for any attorney to understand.  Critics were also adamant that Harris willfully violated the spending cap and argued that, even if Harris mistakenly overspent the cap, that doing so was indefensible under the law.<ref name=Continue/>

Harris ran a "Notice to Voters" in newspapers stating that she never agreed to limit her campaign spending, but said her failure to file the form (to decline the campaign spending cap) on time on was "due to errors by her campaign."<ref name=Notice>{{cite news|author=Kamala Harris|title=Notice to Voters|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=20 Oct 2003}}</ref>  Harris' campaign lawyer also argued that the spending cap violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].  Harris' campaign was questioned on why she would agree to the spending limit if it was, in fact, unconstitutional.  Harris' campaign responded that political candidates face political pressure "to accept rules that hinder their constitutional rights."<ref name=Continue/>

Harris was fined nearly $35,000 by the Commission and ordered to alert voters, in her mailers, that she had violated the spending limit.  The mailers, subsequently produced by her campaign, were said to have displayed her spending violation with "the smallest font in America."<ref name=Continue/>

Harris, who the [[San Francisco Examiner]] called "a relative unknown", went on to spend nearly $625,000 throughout the campaign while Hallinan spent just over $285,000.<ref name=Ousts>{{cite news|author=Alison Soltau and Ethan Fletcher|title=Harris ousts veteran Hallinan|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=10 Dec 2003}}</ref>  It was more than four times more than any candidate had raised in the history of running for the office.<ref name=Launched/>

====Runoff election====
[[File:MS5 1047 0.jpg|thumb|[[Baldwin Hills, Los Angeles|Baldwin Hills]], 2014]]
Harris garnered negative press from the campaign spending violation, but was said to have run a "forceful" campaign, assisted with the political and personal backing of former boyfriend, mayor [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]], and connections to the city's [[High society (social class)|high society]].<ref name=Ousts/><ref name=Launched/> Harris secured "an impressive array" of endorsements, including from Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]], Sheriff [[Michael Hennessey]], writer and cartoonist [[Aaron McGruder]] (who Harris noted was a close friend), and comedians [[Eddie Griffin]] and [[Chris Rock]].<ref name=Ousts/><ref name=Sunset>{{cite news|author=Adriel Hampton|title=Harris stumps in the Sunset|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=28 Jul 2003}}</ref><ref name=Celebs>{{cite news|author=J.K. Dineen and Adriel Hampton|title=Clinton Tops List of Celebrity Supporters|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=9 Dec 2003}}</ref>

Bill Fazio had been eliminated from the election after initial voting. Hallinan and Harris, who garnered 37% and 33% of the vote, respectively, would have a [[Two-round system|runoff]].<ref name=Runoff>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Two to Duel in SF Mayor Runoff; Vallejo Intinoli's Win|publisher=The Napa Valley Register|date=5 Nov 2003}}</ref>

In the runoff, Harris sought to differentiate her policy positions from those of Hallinan, as it was a "problem" that they ideologically agreed on key issues such as being against the use of the [[capital punishment|death penalty]].<ref name=Karma/>  Harris ran on making the [[sexual abuse]] of children her top issue.<ref name=Struggle>{{cite news|author=Adriel Hampton|title=Kamala Harris' struggle for self-definition|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=28 Oct 2003}}</ref>  She charged that, though she worked for Hallinan for two years, she left his office because it was "dysfunctional," technologically inept and was "a mess."  She attacked Hallinan for promoting people in his office without [[Meritocracy|merit]], for his "abysmal" conviction rate for [[felony|serious crimes]] (at just under 65%) –– over 10 percent lower than [[Arlo Smith|his predecessor's]] rate –– lowering office morale, and for his willingness to accept [[Plea bargaining in the United States|plea bargains]] in cases of [[domestic violence]]:<ref name=Ousts/><ref name=Struggle/><ref name=Karma/>

{{quote|"It is not progressive to be soft on crime."<ref name=Karma/> –– Kamala Harris, 2003}}

Hallinan refuted that Harris was misrepresenting his office.  For example, he stated the decrease in [[conviction rate]] was not due to the performance of his office, but because of a [[diversion program]] that he created for criminals.<ref name=Karma/>

Harris was lauded for her campaigning skills, particularly for "listen[ing] carefully to the concerns of ordinary people."<ref name=Karma/>  She was rumored to have worked 16 hours per day on her campaign, but was charged by critics as being a "machine" candidate more concerned with conviction rates than the people who were actually convicted:<ref name=Struggle/><ref name=Karma/>

{{quote|"It's not the tradition in San Francisco to favor punishment over [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]]. We are not concerned with the conviction rate, we don't want to come down hard on people accused of crimes, we don't want to nail them to the cross.”<ref name=Karma/> –– Jeff Adachi, ''Public Defender'', 2003}}

Harris also accrued negative publicity.  Being [[upper middle class]] she was portrayed as being out of touch with her self-described "black base."<ref name=Karma/>  She reportedly told a group of affluent blacks at [[Yerba Buena Gardens]], along with affluent whites in Pacific Heights, "The most victimized people do not vote, so you have to act on their behalf.”<ref name=Karma/>  Also, while talking to three black men, outside of a [[Visitacion Valley, San Francisco|Sunnydale]] [[Subsidized housing in the United States|housing project]], who planned to protest [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|the Muni transit system]] for not honoring its promise to hire young blacks to work on a new [[Light rail in the United States|light-rail system]], Harris suggested they "ask a police captain to conduct a protest training [so] you can protest safely."  The organizer of the protest, Harold Kyer, was reportedly embarrassed to have to explain to Harris that her suggestion was naive:

{{quote|"Our community is not police-friendly, Ms. Harris.  They will not come to a meeting if the police show up."<ref name=Karma/>}}

Harris faced additional criticism.  Her support of Proposition M, which would increase criminal penalties for [[Begging|panhandling]] without providing funds for housing or health services for the homeless, conflicted with her [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] platform. However, the stance aligned her with Mayoral candidate, [[Gavin Newsom]], whose campaign was supporting the initiative. Harris was also criticized, near the end of the campaign, for holding a press conference in which she vocalized a case about a woman who was tortured by her boyfriend with a hot iron, in order to attack Hallinan's record on [[domestic violence]].<ref name=Respect>{{cite news|author=Adriel Hampton|title=Domestic violence victim says DA Hallinan showed respect|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=8 Dec 2003}}</ref>  Harris did not talk to, or consult with, the victim prior to citing the case.  However, Hallinan did speak with the victim and her family.  The victim subsequently praised Hallinan for "respect[ing] her desire not to have the case become a media spectacle."  Harris was accused of politicizing the victim.<ref name=Respect/>

Harris won with 56.33% of the vote and became the first woman to lead the District Attorney's Office of San Francisco.<ref name=Ousts/>

[[File:Kamala Harris IMG 0779.jpg|thumb|right|Harris press conference]]
In April 2004, [[San Francisco Police Department]] Officer Isaac Espinoza was shot and killed in the line of duty. Three days later, Harris announced she would not seek the [[death penalty]], angering the [[San Francisco Police Officers Association]]. During Espinoza's funeral at [[Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption (San Francisco, California)|St. Mary's Cathedral]], U.S. Senator and former San Francisco mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] rose to the pulpit and called on Harris, who was sitting in the front pew, to secure the death penalty, prompting a standing ovation from the 2,000 uniformed police officers in attendance. Harris still refused. Espinoza's killer was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.<ref name=NYTmag/>

In 2004, as district attorney, Harris started the Back On Track initiative, a reentry program.<ref name=NYTmag/> Initiative participants (who are nonviolent, first-time drug offenders whose crimes were not weapon- or gang-related) plead guilty in exchange for a deferral of sentencing and regular appearances before a judge over a year-long period.

=== Violent crimes and conviction rate ===
[[File:AG Kamala Harris.jpg|thumb|Attorney General, 2010]]
While Harris was the [[San Francisco District Attorney's Office|San Francisco District Attorney]], the overall felony conviction rate rose from 52% in 2003 to 67% in 2006, the highest in a decade; there was an 85% conviction rate for homicides, and convictions of drug dealers increased from 56% in 2003 to 74% in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kamalaharris.org/issues/34 |title=Convicting Felons – Kamala Harris |date=January 3, 2008 |access-date=April 19, 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103072145/http://www.kamalaharris.org/issues/34 |archivedate=January 3, 2008 }}</ref> In addition to trial convictions, she also closed many cases via [[plea bargain]]s.

When Harris took office, she cleared part of the murder caseload from the previous administration. She stated that the records from that administration were less than ideal, and worked to get convictions on what she could. Out of the 73 homicide cases backlogged, over 40% of them took deals for lesser charges, such as [[manslaughter]], pleaded to other crimes, such as [[assault]] or [[burglary]] while the murder charges were dismissed.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jaxon|last=Van Derbeken|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-03-20/news/17287759_1_conviction-handling-of-criminal-cases-homicide/4|title=Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=March 20, 2006|page=4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118160154/http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-03-20/news/17287759_1_conviction-handling-of-criminal-cases-homicide/4 |archive-date=January 18, 2012 }}</ref>

In 2004, Harris pushed for higher bail for criminal [[defendant]]s involved in gun-related crimes. She argued that low [[bail]] encouraged outsiders to commit crimes in San Francisco.

Officers within the [[San Francisco Police Department|SFPD]] credited Harris with tightening [[loophole]]s in bail and drug programs that defendants had used in the past. However, they also accused her of being too deliberate in her prosecution of murder suspects.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jaxon|last=Van Derbeken|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/03/20/MNG01HQVPA1.DTL|title=Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=March 20, 2006|accessdate=March 9, 2019}}</ref>

In 2009, Harris' prosecutors won a lower percentage of their [[felony]] jury trials than their counterparts at district attorneys' offices covering the 10 largest cities in California.  Her at-trial felony conviction rate that year was 76 percent, down 12 percent from the previous year, was more than 5 percent under the statewide average.<ref name="Lack of Conviction">{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Jamison|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-05-05/news/a-lack-of-conviction/|title=A Lack of Conviction|newspaper=[[SF Weekly]]|publisher=San Francisco Media Company|location=San Francisco, California|date=May 5, 2010|accessdate=March 9, 2019}}</ref>

In 2012, Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo ruled that Harris's office violated defendants' rights by hiding damaging information about a San Francisco Police Department crime lab technician, that Harris' office had ignored a constitutional obligation to turn over to defense attorneys the criminal histories of police testifying at trial, and that Harris' office was indifferent to demands that it account for its failings.<ref name="SFVanDerbeken">{{cite news|first=Jaxon|last=Van Derbeken|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/05/21/BAN01DHVMU.DTL|title=Judge rips Harris' office for hiding problems|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=July 28, 2010}}</ref><ref name=Secrecy>{{cite news|author=Matt Smith|title=A Secrecy Fetish|url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/a-secrecy-fetish/Content?oid=2177326|publisher=San Francisco Weekly|date=2 Jun 2010}}</ref>

==== Child Abuse in Catholic Church ====
[[File:Kamala Harris.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Dept. of Justice, 2013]]
In the 1970s, Joey Piscitelli, was repeatedly [[rape]]d by the principal of his [[Catholic schools in the United States|Catholic High School]], Father Stephen Whelan.<ref name=Cooperating>{{cite news|author=Lee Fang|title=As San Francisco District Attorney, Kamala Harris's Office Stopped Cooperating with Victimes of Catholic Church Child Abuse|url=https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/kamala-harris-san-francisco-catholic-church-child-abuse/|publisher=[[The Intercept]]|date=9 Jun 2019}}</ref> In 2004, he was pursuing a [[civil court|civil case]] against the church that oversaw his high school and seeking help to strengthen his case.

Piscitelli had previously gone to the District Attorney's office, when Terrance Hallinan was the D.A., and was receiving the assistance he requested.  Hallinan's office provided Piscitelli with access to files it had obtained in 2002 after Hallinan directed investigators to try to build a case against the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|archdiocese]] and forced the archdiocese to turn over 75 years of its own records.<ref name=Cooperating/>  The files implicated high-level church officials and how they internally handled [[pedophile]] priests.<ref name=Coddles>{{cite news|author=Try Bundy|title=Kamala Harris Takes A Stand on Internet Pedophiles, Coddles Pedophile Catholic Priests|publisher=San Francisco Weekly|date=3 Jun 2010}}</ref><ref name=Secrecy/>  The files had been successfully used to indict a priest –– Father Austin Peter Keegan.<ref name=Cooperating/>

Piscitelli intended to use the files in a similar manner, seeking to find any information that could be helpful in his civil suit against the church that oversaw his high school.  At the time, a civil trial was the only avenue for [[restitution]] available to victims following a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision [[Stogner v. California|overturned a California law]] that retroactively eliminated the [[statute of limitations]] for criminal prosecution of child molestation cases.<ref name=Cooperating/>  Many sexual abusers, who were facing criminal charges prior to the ruling, were set free, including Keegan.<ref name=Cooperating/><ref name=Keegan>{{cite news|author=Richard Somerville and The Associated Press|title=Accused priest to walk free|url=https://www.theunion.com/news/local-news/accused-priest-to-walk-free/|publisher=The Union|date=27 Jun 2003}}</ref>  However, in 2003, California passed a state law that allowed victims to file civil lawsuits against their alleged abusers if they could prove that the employers of the abusers knew of the misconduct and did nothing to stop it.<ref name=Cooperating/>  Piscitelli's civil suit was already underway when he contacted Harris, shortly after she defeated Hallinan.
 
Piscitelli says Harris' office did not respond to his letters or calls, and would not allow him to access the files.  In response, Piscitelli and his family and friends began mounting posters across the city to force Harris to respond.  He sought help from the media, which requested access to the files under [[California Public Records Act|California's Public Records Act]], but Harris' deputy, Paul Henderson, denied the request, stating that Harris' investigative files "were not subject to California's government transparency laws."<ref name=Secrecy/> In 2005, when [[San Francisco Weekly]] writer, Ron Russell, attempted the request again, a Harris spokesperson told him:

{{quote|"If we did it [granted access to files] for you, we would have to do it for everybody. Where do you stop, and where do you start?"<ref name=Secrecy/>}}

Repeated attempts by reporters to access the files were similarly denied over the years, with Harris' spokesperson, Erica Derryck, not responding to calls or emails from reporters.  Eventually, in 2010, Harris' office released a statement:

{{quote|"District Attorney Harris focuses her efforts on putting child molesters in prison. We're not interested in selling out our victims to look good in the paper. When this case was brought under Terence Hallinan, prosecutors took the utmost care to protect the identity and dignity of the victims. That was the right thing to do then and it's the right thing to do now."<ref name=Secrecy/>}}

Critics charged that the statement was "dangerous," as not exposing predators could endanger more children.<ref name=Secrecy/>  They argued that releasing such records was not only "routine," but also cruel, in that it further burdened victims with having to resort to costly litigation if they wanted to obtain records that documented the crimes that happened against them.<ref name=Secrecy/>  Critics also charged that the statement implied that the District Attorney's office was incapable of simply redacting victims' names from the released material.<ref name=Secrecy/><ref name=Cooperating/>  They speculated that Harris, considering her political future, gave deference to the Catholic Church, noted to be a major political influencer in San Francisco.<ref name=Cooperating/>

However, supporters of Harris maintain she did the right thing in not releasing the documents:

{{quote|"I don’t think a district attorney should float that out there if a person can’t defend themselves.  It’s a very serious charge, a sex crime."<ref name=Cooperating/>  –– Elliot Beckelman, Former San Francisco Assistant District Attorney}}

In 2006, Piscitelli won his civil case, doing so without the help of Harris's office.<ref name=Survivors>{{cite news|author=Try Bundy|title=Survivors of Priest Abuse Make Proposal to Church|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/us/24bcclergy.html|date=23 Apr 2011}}</ref>

During her seven years as District Attorney, Harris did not bring charges, or proactively assist in civil cases, against any sexual abusers in the church.<ref name=Cooperating/>  Critics charge that her failure to do so conflicts with her campaign promise to make the sexual abuse of children her top issue.<ref name=Struggle/><ref name=Cooperating/>

=== Hate crimes and civil rights ===
[[File:Kamala Harris Img64.jpg|thumb|Pride Parade, 2013]]
As San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created a special Hate Crimes Unit, focusing on [[hate crime]]s against [[LGBT]] children and teens in schools. She convened a national conference to confront the "gay-[[transgender]] [[gay panic|panic defense]]", which has been used to justify violent [[hate crime]]s.<ref>{{cite web|first=Niraj|last=Choksi|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/09/05/california-could-become-the-first-state-to-ban-the-gay-panic-defense/|title=California could become the first state to ban the 'gay panic' defense|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|location=Washington DC|date=September 5, 2014|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}</ref> She supports [[same-sex marriage]] in California and opposed both [[Proposition 22]] and [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kamalaharris.org/MarriageEquality|title=Marriage Equality|publisher=Kamalaharris.org|accessdate=November 18, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125112342/http://kamalaharris.org/MarriageEquality|archivedate=November 25, 2010}}</ref>

In 2004, The [[National Urban League]] honored Harris as a "Woman of Power". In 2005, she received the [[Thurgood Marshall#Thurgood Marshall Award|Thurgood Marshall Award]] from the National Black Prosecutors Association. In her campaign for California Attorney General, she received the endorsements of many groups including [[EMILY's List]], [[California Legislative Black Caucus]], [[Asian American Action Fund]], [[Black Women Organized for Political Action]], the [[National Women's Political Caucus]], Mexican American Bar Association, and South Asians for Opportunity.<ref name="Endorsements">{{cite web|url=http://kamalaharris.org/endorsements|title=Endorsements|date=September 24, 2010|publisher=Kamalaharris.org|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}{{better source|date=July 2019}}</ref>

=== Significant cases and policies ===

====Housing====
In 2012, Harris participated in the National Mortgage Settlement against five banks, securing $12 billion of debt reduction for the state's homeowners and $26 billion overall.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Kamala-Harris-foreclosure-deal-a-win-for-state-3381270.php | title=Kamala Harris' foreclosure deal a win for state | date=March 5, 2012 | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | author1=Parker, Barbara | author2=Rebecca Kaplan | accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/12/business/la-fi-0512-harris-housing-20120512 |title=Mortgage deal cash is divvied | date=May 12, 2012 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Lazo, Alejandro |accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref>

She introduced the California Homeowner's Bill of Rights in the [[California State Legislature]], a set of laws which took effect on January 1, 2013, banning the practices of "dual-tracking" (processing a modification and foreclosure at the same time) and [[robo-signing]], and provided homeowners with a single point of contact at their lending institution. It also gave the California Attorney General more power to investigate and prosecute financial fraud and to convene special [[grand jury|grand juries]] to prosecute multi-county crimes instead of prosecuting a single crime county by county.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-passage-bills-california-homeowner | title=Attorney General Kamala D.

==== Prison conditions and sentencing reform ====
After the United States Supreme Court in ''[[Brown v. Plata]]'' (2011) declared California's prisons so overcrowded they inflicted [[cruel and unusual punishment]], Harris fought federal court supervision, explaining "I have a client, and I don't get to choose my client."<ref name="NYTmag" /> After California failed to fully implement the court's order to reduce crowding, and was ordered to implement new parole programs, the State of California appealed the decision, and in court filings the AG's office argued that if forced to release these inmates early, prisons would lose an important source of labor,<ref name="latimes_20141114">{{cite news|last1=St. John|first1=Paige|title=Federal judges order California to expand prison releases|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-ff-federal-judges-order-state-to-release-more-prisoners-20141114-story.html|access-date=October 12, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> such as for [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection|fighting wildfires]].<ref name="Neklason">{{cite magazine|first=Annika|last=Neklason|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/how-much-longer-will-inmates-fight-californias-wildfires/547628/|title=California Is Running Out of Inmates to Fight Its Fires|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[Emerson Collective]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=December 7, 2017}}</ref> Prisoners in California earn between 8 and 37 cents per hour in maintenance and kitchen jobs;<ref name="latimes_20141114"/> prisoner firefighters receive higher pay, at $1 per hour.<ref name="Neklason"/> She later backed away from her office's argument in the prison-litigation case, telling the website ''[[ThinkProgress]]'': "The way that argument played out in court does not reflect my priorities...

In 2017, she introduced legislation to "reform or replace the practice of money bail."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/31/politics/fact-check-democratic-debate-night-2/index.html|title=Fact check: CNN's Democratic debate, night 2|last=staff|first=C.

Harris refused to take any position on criminal sentencing-reform initiatives [[California Proposition 36, 2012|Proposition 36 (2012)]] and [[California Proposition 47 (2014)|Proposition 47 (2014)]], arguing it would be improper because her office prepares the ballot booklets.<ref name="NYTmag" /> Former California Attorney General [[John Van de Kamp]] considered her explanation "baloney."<ref name="NYTmag" />

==== Bureau of Children's Justice ====
[[File:2016-ag-truancy-006 0.jpg|thumb|John Muir Elementary, 2016]]
On February 12, 2015, Harris announced that she would start a new agency called the Bureau of Children's Justice. The bureau would work on issues such as [[foster care]], the juvenile justice system, school [[truancy]], and childhood trauma. She appointed special assistant attorney general Jill Habig to head the agency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/news/kamala-harris-bureau-of-childrens-justice-taking-shape/9513|title=Kamala Harris' Bureau of Children's Justice Takes Shape|last=Heimpel|first=Daniel|date=February 28, 2015|website=The Chronicle of Social Change|location=San Francisco|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref>

==== County prosecutors' misconduct ====
In 2015, Harris defended convictions obtained by county prosecutors who had inserted a false confession into an interrogation transcript, committed perjury, and withheld evidence.<ref name="NYTmag" /> Federal appeals court Judge [[Alex Kozinski]] threw out the convictions, telling lawyers, "Talk to the attorney general and make sure she understands the gravity of the situation."<ref name="NYTmag" />

In March 2015, a [[California superior courts]] judge ordered Harris to take over a criminal case after [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] District Attorney [[Tony Rackauckas]] was revealed to have illegally employed jailhouse informants and concealed evidence.<ref name="NYTmag" /> She refused, appealing the order and defending Rackauckas.<ref name="NYTmag" />

Harris appealed the dismissal of an indictment when it was discovered a [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] prosecutor perjured in submitting a falsified confession as court evidence. In the case, she argued that only abject physical brutality would warrant a finding of prosecutorial misconduct and the dismissal of an indictment, and that perjury alone was not enough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2015/03/california-prosecutor-falsifies-transcript-of-confession/|title=California Prosecutor Falsifies Transcript of Confession|date=March 4, 2015|website=The Observer|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2781830/people-v-velasco-palacios-ca5/|title=People v.

==== Mitrice Richardson case ====
{{main|Death of Mitrice Richardson}}
Mitrice Richardson was a 24-year-old African American woman who was released from the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department in the middle of the night without any means of fending for herself. Her body was later found in an isolated canyon, leaving the family with many unanswered questions. In 2016, the Attorney General opened a criminal investigation into the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]]'s handling of the Mitrice Richardson case. The AG's Office had originally declined the request of the Richardson family to investigate the case, but reversed course after the family and supporters submitted almost 500 pages of evidence to Harris's office in the hope of prompting an investigation.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20160212/california-attorney-general-opens-criminal-investigation-into-sheriffs-department-over-mitrice-richardson-case|title=California attorney general opens criminal investigation into Sheriff's Department over Mitrice Richardson case|access-date=December 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/she-went-missing-from-a-sheriffs-station-now-the-state-wants-answers-6606452|title=She Went Missing From a Sheriff's Station.

In October 2016, Harris announced the arrest of [[Backpage]] CEO Carl Ferrer on felony charges of [[pimping]] a [[Minor (law)|minor]], pimping, and conspiracy to commit pimping.

[[File:Kamala Harris for Senate.svg|thumb|right|Senate campaign logo, 2016]]

After 24 years as California's [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior senator]], Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] (D-CA) announced her intention to retire from the [[United States Senate]] at the end of her term in 2016. Harris was the first candidate to declare her intention to run for Boxer's senate seat. Media outlets reported that she would run for senate on the same day that [[Gavin Newsom]], California's [[lieutenant governor of California|Lieutenant Governor]] and a close political ally of Harris, announced he would not seek to succeed Boxer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/12/politics/kamala-harris-california-senate/|publisher=CNN|title=Kamala Harris to announce U.S. Senate bid Tuesday|date=January 12, 2015|accessdate=January 12, 2015}}</ref> Harris officially announced the launch of her campaign on January 13, 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-harris-launches-us-senate-bid-begins-raising-money-20150113-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Kamala Harris launches U.S. Senate bid, begins raising money|first=Seema|last=Mehta|date=January 13, 2015|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}</ref>

In December 2015, the ''[[National Journal]]'' reported that Harris' campaign spending rate contributed to her cash on hand being closer to that of another candidate, [[Loretta Sanchez]], who had just $1.6 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/harris-696063-sanchez-travel.html|title=California Attorney General Kamala Harris scrutinized for luxury travel, expenses|date=December 14, 2015|work=[[The Orange County Register]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/s/125536/posh-hotels-pricey-airfare-meet-senate-candidate-driving-some-democrats-crazy|title=Posh Hotels And Pricey Airfare: Meet the Senate Candidate Driving Democrats Crazy|date=December 6, 2015|work=National Journal}}</ref>

====Support====
Harris was a frontrunner from the beginning of her campaign.

In January 2015, weeks after she announced her campaign, a survey by [[Public Policy Polling]] showed her leading in a hypothetical match-up against Los Angeles Mayor [[Antonio Villaraigosa]], 41% to 16%, respectively.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/poll-kamala-harris-barbara-boxer-seat-114533|title=Internal poll puts Harris well ahead in California Senate race|date=January 23, 2015|work=[[Politico]]}}</ref> Four months later, a Field Poll showed that though nearly 60% of likely voters did not have a favored candidate, at nearly 20%, she was most preferred candidate of the field.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_28152997/field-poll-kamala-harris-leads-senate-contenders-except|title=Poll: Kamala Harris leads California Senate contenders, except for 'undecided'|first=Josh|last=Richman|work=San Jose Mercury News}}</ref> Five months later, she led another Field Poll, at 30%, besting fellow Democratic candidate, [[Loretta Sanchez]], by nearly 15 percentage points.

== Political positions ==
===Abortion===
[[File:Kamala Harris meeting with advocates from Planned Parenthood Action Fund C53hx uU8AIwn t (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Planned Parenthood|Planned Parenthood Action Fund]], 2017]]
In 2013, when she was California Attorney General, Harris allowed the Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian to cease the availability of elective abortions, after it entered a partnership with Catholic chain, St. Joseph Health System.<ref name=Hoag>{{cite news|author=Seema Mehta|title=Devious Ban on Abortion at Hoag|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=23 Jun 2013}}</ref> The ban was made due to St. Joseph's "sensitivity" about abortion.  As the Attorney General, Harris had legal authority to decide on any such change, as a condition of her approving a major transaction involving any non-profit medical institution in the state.<ref name=Hoag/>  The ban would not be able to go into affect without her knowledge or approval.<ref name=Hoag/>  Harris did set conditions on the ban, requiring the hospital to "take steps to ensure that alternative providers are available and accessible to all women, especially low-income women for direct abortions" in the hospital's serviceable area.<ref name=Hoag/>

Critics voiced concern that by imposing Catholic doctrine on its operations, St. Joseph was reducing the availability of reproductive services while receiving millions of dollars from taxpayers through Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements and a legal status that allowed it to be tax-exempt while taking tax deductions.<ref name=Hoag/>

In July 2015, an organization called "The Center for Medical Progress" ([[Trade name|dba]] "Biomax"), a registered California non-profit corporation posted five videos, shot in Texas, as evidence of proof that [[Planned Parenthood]] was "illegally trafficking aborted fetal parts."<ref name=Firestorm>{{cite news|author=Christine Mai-Duc|title=An antiabortion firestorm|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=8 Aug 2015}}</ref>  The videos were found to be manipulated –– [[propaganda]] produced by [[Anti-abortion movement|anti-abortion activists]] who used fake California identification to establish a [[Shell corporation|ghost]] California non-profit corporation.<ref name=Stand>{{cite news|author=Robin Abcarian|title=Where Does Kamala Harris Stand?|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=25 Mar 2016}}</ref>  Within two months of the videos' posting, a Texas grand jury indicted the two activists responsible for producing them.  However, as of March 2016, Harris had yet to make any determination on the matter:

{{quote|"In July, our politically ambitious attorney general, Kamala Harris, vowed to 'carefully review' the 'Center for Medical Progress...what is [she] waiting for?'<ref name=Stand/>}}

While a spokesperson for Harris said that "the office does not comment on investigations, or even confirm whether an investigation exists," abortion rights advocates began to speculate that Harris' senatorial campaign to replace [[Barbara Boxer]] might have contributed to Harris' "lack of urgency" on the case.<ref name=Stand/>

However, in September 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed "Assembly Bill 1671" into law, which was reportedly drafted by Harris, with input from Planned Parenthood –– which sponsored the bill –– making it a criminal offense to intentionally distribute, or to help with the dissemination of, unlawfully obtained confidential communications.<ref name=Criminalize>{{cite news|author=Alexandra Desantis|title=California Governor Signs Bill to Criminalize Whistleblowing|publisher=National Review|date=20 Sep 2016}}</ref><ref name=AB1671>{{cite news|title=AB-1671 Confidential communications: disclosure|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1671|publisher=California Legislative Information|date=30 Sep 2016}}</ref> [[Libertarianism in the United States|Libertarians]], filmmakers and news organizations vehemently opposed the bill which was signed into law after late amendments were added to it.<ref name=BadBill>{{cite news|author=Editorial|title=Planned Parenthood's Bad Bill|publisher=LA Times|date=31 Aug 2016}}</ref>

=== Animals ===
In February 2019, Harris and Republican [[Susan Collins]] introduced the Help Extract Animals from Red Tape Act (HEART Act), a bill meant to assist animals previously rescued by the federal government from being used in animal fights. Harris remarked that she was "proud to reintroduce this bill to streamline the process of getting these animals the care they need and ensuring that they are properly cared for in the future."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/cnsnewscom-staff/sen-kamala-harris-when-our-government-saves-animals-have-been-victims|title=Sen.

===Campaign finance===
[[File:Kamala Harris (48217605397).jpg|thumb|right|Des Moines, Iowa 2019]]
Harris's 2020 campaign has disavowed most corporate donations, and has committed to rejecting money from corporate political action committees for her presidential campaign, in favor of relying on small and large individual donors.<ref name="Herndon 2019"/><ref name="Reuters 2019"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/us/politics/democrats-2020-donors.html|title=2020 Democrats Love Small Donors.

However, in April 2019, after the [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]] released donation information, Harris was found to have accepted more donations from registered lobbyists among all the Democratic Presidential Nominees who vowed to not do so,<ref name=Accepted/> receiving such donations from federal, state, municipal and corporate lobbyists who represent entities such as [[Verizon]], [[Airbnb]], [[AT&T]], [[Novartis]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[Pfizer]], [[Cigna]], [[IBM]], [[Google]], along with lobbyists that represent industries such as [[charter school]]s, construction, and real estate.<ref name=Accepted/>

Harris, along with candidates [[Cory Booker]], [[Julian Castro]], [[Tulsi Gabbard]], [[Kirsten Gillibrand]], [[Amy Klobuchar]], [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Elizabeth Warren]], and [[Marianne Williamson]], has explicitly discouraged single-candidate super PACs from operating on her behalf, though she cannot prevent them from doing so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://readsludge.com/2019/04/01/where-the-2020-candidates-stand-on-campaign-finance/|title=Where the 2020 Candidates Stand on Campaign Finance|author=|date=|website=Sludge|access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref>

In the first quarter of 2019, nearly 40% of Harris's donations came from small donors (donations of less than $200), while over 60% of her donations came from large donors (donations of $200 or more).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-fundraising-idUSKCN1RS0A9 |title=Most Democratic presidential hopefuls still relying on large campaign donations |date=April 16, 2019}}</ref>

=== Cannabis ===
Harris did not initially support the legalization of recreational marijuana, but later moved to support legalization.<ref name="Herndon 2019">{{cite news |last1=Herndon |first1=Astead |title=Kamala Harris Joins Democratic Presidential Field |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-president.html |accessdate=January 21, 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=January 21, 2019 |quote=But like many Democrats, she has sought to align herself with the party's leftward drift in recent years, proclaiming her support for “Medicare for All” and, after an initial hesitation, disavowing most corporate donations and embracing the legalization of recreational marijuana, which Ms. Harris once rebuffed.}}</ref> In 2010, while campaigning for Attorney General of California, she opposed [[2010 California Proposition 19|Proposition 19]], the first failed attempt to legalize recreational marijuana in California, on the grounds that selling drugs harms communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reason.com/2019/02/11/kamala-harris-says-opposition-to-marijua/|title=Kamala Harris Says Her Opposition to Marijuana Legalization Is 'Not True.'

In April 2018, following reports that the Justice Department was blocking the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] from taking action on over two dozen requests to grow marijuana for use in research, Harris and Republican [[Orrin Hatch]] sent a letter to Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] on the necessity of marijuana research "for evidence-based decision making" and "to resolve critical questions of public health and safety, such as learning the impacts of marijuana on developing brains and formulating methods to test marijuana impairment in drivers."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/public-global-health/382858-hatch-harris-call-for-doj-to-stop-blocking-medical|title=Senators call for DOJ to stop blocking medical marijuana research|date=April 12, 2018|first=Nathaniel|last=Weixel|publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

In May 2018, Harris announced she would co-sponsor the Marijuana Justice Act, which Senator [[Cory Booker]] introduced in August 2017. The legislation would eliminate [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]'s status as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] drug under the [[Controlled Substance Act]]. The move would also require federal courts to automatically expunge earlier federal marijuana convictions related to use or possession and would establish a grant program aimed at incentivizing the expungement and sealing of state convictions for marijuana possession.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/regulation/legislation/387101-kamala-harris-backs-booker-bill-to-legalize-marijuana |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=May 10, 2018 |title=Kamala Harris backs Booker bill to legalize marijuana |accessdate=August 9, 2018|first=Aris |last=Folley}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Liszewski |url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/blog/unprecedented-action-congress-sends-signals-ending-federal-marijuana-prohibition-could-finally|publisher=[[Drug Policy Alliance]]|date=June 28, 2018|title=Unprecedented Action in Congress Sends Signals that Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Could Finally Become Reality}}</ref>

In July 2019, Harris and Representative [[Jerry Nadler]] introduced the MORE Act of 2019, legislation that would decriminalize marijuana on the federal level in addition to expunging low-level marijuana possession convictions and authorizing grants to members of communities of color as part of an effort to reverse decades of damage cannabis criminalization had inflicted to those respective communities. In a statement, Harris cited the need to regulate marijuana and ensuring "everyone — especially communities of color that have been disproportionately impacted by the War on Drugs — has a real opportunity to participate in this growing industry."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/kamala-harris-marijuana-bill-legalize-tax-weed-pot-862192/|title=Sen.

=== Election security ===
On December 21, 2017, Harris was one of six senators to introduce the "Secure Elections Act", legislation authorizing [[block grants]] for states that would update outdated voting technology. The act would also create a program for an independent panel of experts to develop [[cybersecurity]] guidelines for election systems that states could adopt if they choose, along with offering states resources to implement the recommendations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/365986-bipartisan-group-of-lawmakers-introduces-new-election-security-bill|title=Bipartisan group of lawmakers backs new election security bill|date=December 21, 2017|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

In October 2017, Harris was one of nineteen senators to sign a letter to [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Scott Pruitt]] questioning Pruitt's decision to repeal the [[Clean Power Plan]], asserting that the repeal's proposal used "mathematical sleights of hand to over-state the costs of industry compliance with the 2015 Rule and understate the benefits that will be lost if the 2017 repeal is finalized" and science denying and math fabricating would fail to "satisfy the requirements of the law, nor will it slow the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the inexorable rise in sea levels, or the other dire effects of global warming that our planet is already experiencing."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/357446-19-sens-question-epa-methodology-behind-clean-power-plan-repeal|title=19 sens question EPA methodology behind Clean Power Plan repeal|first=Julia|last=Manchester|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

On July 29, 2019, Harris and Ocasio-Cortez introduced the Climate Equity Act, a bill that would lay out steps for Congress and the White House on how to go about guaranteeing policies that composed "a future Green New Deal protect the health and economic wellbeing of all Americans for generations to come." Referring to climate change as "an existential threat", Harris noted cutting emissions and ending American reliance on fossil fuels were not enough and cited the need "that communities already contending with unsafe drinking water, toxic air, and lack of economic opportunity are not left behind."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455193-harris-aoc-unveil-first-step-of-green-new-deal|title=Harris, Ocasio-Cortez unveil first step of Green New Deal|first=Rebecca|last=Beitsch|publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

She pledged to rejoin the [[Paris Agreement]] and end U.S. support for international oil and natural gas extraction projects, furthering that as president she would "hold polluters accountable for the damage they inflict upon our environment and set us on a path to a 100 percent clean economy that creates millions of good-paying jobs."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/459846-harris-eyes-10t-climate-plan|title=Harris eyes $10T climate plan|first=John|last=Bowden|date=September 4, 2019|publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

On August 30, 2017, Harris announced at a town hall in Oakland that she would co-sponsor fellow Senator [[Bernie Sanders]]' "Medicare for All" bill, supporting [[single-payer healthcare]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weigel|first1=David|title=Sen.

In April 2018, Harris was one of ten senators to sponsor the Choose Medicare Act, an expanded public option for health insurance that also increased ObamaCare subsidies and rendered individuals with higher income levels eligible for its assistance.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/383764-dem-senators-unveil-expanded-public-option-for-health-insurance|title=Dem senators unveil expanded public option for health insurance|date=April 18, 2018|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

In December 2018, Harris was one of 42 senators to sign a letter to Trump administration officials [[Alex Azar]], [[Seema Verma]], and [[Steve Mnuchin]] arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to "increase health care costs for millions of consumers while weakening protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions." The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and "re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://urbanmilwaukee.com/pressrelease/u-s-senator-tammy-baldwin-calls-on-trump-administration-to-stop-pushing-health-insurance-plans-that-weaken-pre-existing-condition-protections/|title=U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin Calls on Trump Administration to Stop Pushing Health Insurance Plans that Weaken Pre-Existing Condition Protections|date=December 20, 2018|publisher=urbanmilwaukee.com}}</ref>

On July 29, 2019, Harris unveiled a health plan that would expand coverage while preserving a role for private insurance companies, the plan calling for transitioning to a Medicare for All system over a period of ten years that would be concurrent with infants and the uninsured automatically being placed into the system while other individuals would have the option to buy into the health care plan backed by the government.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/455102-kamala-harris-unveils-details-of-health-care-plan-ahead-of-debate|title=Harris's health plan would keep private insurance|date=July 29, 2019|first=Owen|last=Daugherty|publisher=The Hill}}</ref> The plan has been met with some criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/kamala-harris-releases-details-health-care-plan-64628089|title=Kamala Harris' new health plan draws critics from all sides|last=News|first=A.

On October 25, 2017, Harris stated she would not support a spending bill until Congress addressed the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] program in a way that clarified "what we are going to do to protect and take care of our DACA young people in this country."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-sen-kamala-harris-wont-back-federal-1508949513-htmlstory.html|title=Sen.

In a January 2018 interview, when asked by Hiram Soto about her ideal version of a bipartisan deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Harris stated the need to focus on comprehensive immigration reform and "pass a clean [[DREAM Act]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/hoy-san-diego/noticias/san-diego/sdhoy-sen-kamala-harris-talks-daca-future-run-for-president-20180112-story.html|title=Senator Kamala Harris talks DACA amid heated negotiations |date=January 12, 2018|first=Hiram|last=Soto|work=U-T San Diego}}</ref>

In January 2018, Harris and three other Democratic senators were cosponsors of the Border and Port Security Act, legislation that would mandate U.S. Customs and Border Protection "hire, train and assign at least 500 officers per year until the number of needed positions the model identifies is filled" in addition to requiring the commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection to determine potential equipment and infrastructure improvements that could be used for ports of entry.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailyinterlake.com/local_news/20180119/tester_wants_more_border_personnel|title=TESTER WANTS MORE BORDER PERSONNEL|date=January 19, 2018|first=Patrick|last=Reilly|publisher=Daily Inter Lake}}</ref>

In April 2018, Harris was one of five senators to send a letter to acting director of ICE [[Thomas Homan]] on standards used by the agency when determining how to detain a pregnant woman, requesting that pregnant women not be held in custody unless under extraordinary standards after reports "that ICE has failed to provide critical medical care to pregnant women in immigration detention&nbsp;– resulting in miscarriages and other negative health outcomes".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/381895-democrats-question-ice-standards-for-detaining-pregnant-women|title=Democrats question ICE standards for detaining pregnant women|date=April 5, 2018|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

In July 2018, Harris was one of 22 senators to sponsor the Stop Shackling and Detaining Pregnant Women Act, which if enacted would prohibit immigration officers from detaining pregnant women in a majority of circumstances and improve conditions of care for individuals in custody.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/397536-dems-to-propose-legislation-to-prevent-ice-from-shackling-pregnant-women|title=Dems to propose legislation to prevent ICE from shackling pregnant women|first=Emily|last=Birnbaum|date=July 17, 2018|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

[[File:U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris speaks at L.A.'s Families Belong Together March.jpg|thumb|Harris speaking at L.A.'s [[Families Belong Together]] protest in June 2018]]
In August 2018, Harris led fifteen Democrats and [[Bernie Sanders]] in a letter to [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security]] [[Kirstjen Nielsen]] demanding that the Trump administration take immediate action in attempting to reunite 539 migrant children with their families, citing each passing day of inaction as intensifying "trauma that this administration has needlessly caused for children and their families seeking humanitarian protection."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/401999-senate-democrats-demand-immediate-reunification-of-remaining-separated|title=Senate Dems demand immediate reunification of remaining separated children|first=Nathaniel|last=Weixel|date=August 15, 2018|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

In November 2018, Harris was one of eleven senators to sign a letter to [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[James Mattis]] concerning "the overt politicization of the military" with the Trump administration's deployment of 5,800 troops to the U.S.–Mexico border, and requesting a briefing and written justification from the U.S. Northern Command for troop deployment, while urging Mattis to "curb the unprecedented escalation of DOD involvement in immigration enforcement."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/417703-2020-democrats-challenge-trumps-use-of-troops-at-mexico-border|title=2020 Democrats challenge Trump's use of troops at Mexico border|date=November 20, 2018|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

In January 2019, Harris was one of twenty senators to sponsor the Dreamer Confidentiality Act, a bill imposing a ban on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from passing information collected on DACA recipients to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Department of Justice, or any other law enforcement agency with exceptions in the case of fraudulent claims, national security issues, or non-immigration related felonies being investigated.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/426478-senate-dems-introduces-bill-to-keep-daca-info-private|title=Senate Dems introduces bill to keep DACA info private|date=January 22, 2019|first=Rafael|last=Bernal|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

In June 2019, following the Housing and Urban Development Department's confirmation that DACA recipients did not meet eligibility for federal backed loans, Harris and eleven other senators introduced The Home Ownership Dreamers Act, legislation that mandated that the federal government was not authorized to deny mortgage loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Agriculture Department solely due to the immigration status of an applicant.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2019/06/21/bob-menendez-cory-booker-bill-home-loans-daca-holders/1513659001/|title=Bob Menendez, Cory Booker and others introduce bill to protect home loans for DACA holders|date=June 21, 2019|publisher=northjersey.com}}</ref>

In July 2019, along with [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] and [[Amy Klobuchar]], Harris sent a letter to the Office of Refugee Resettlement asserting that the agency "should be prioritizing reunification of every child as soon as possible, but instead it has been responsible for policies that are forcing longer stays in government custody for children" and that it was mandatory that the office "ensure that the custody and processing of [unaccompanied migrant children] is meeting the minimum standards required by domestic and international law."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/451563-harris-gillibrand-klobuchar-call-upon-orr-to-reform-migrant-children-policies|title=Harris, Gillibrand, Klobuchar call upon ORR to reform migrant children policies|date=July 3, 2019|first=Rachel|last=Frazin|publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

In July 2019, Harris and fifteen other Senate Democrats introduced the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act which mandated that ICE agents get approval from a supervisor ahead of engaging in enforcement actions at sensitive locations with the exception of special circumstances and that agents receive annual training in addition to being required to report annually regarding enforcement actions in those locations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.10news.com/news/bill-would-block-immigration-raids-at-schools-courthouses|title=Bill would block immigration raids at schools, courthouses|date=July 11, 2019|first=Zac|last=Self|publisher=10news.com}}</ref>

In August 2019, after the Trump administration released a new regulation imposing the possibility that any green card and visa applicants could be turned down in the event they have low incomes or little education and have used benefits such as food stamps and housing vouchers at some point, Harris referred to the regulation as part of President Trump's ongoing campaign "to vilify a whole group of people" and cited Trump's sending of service members to the southern border and building a border wall as part of his goal to distract "from the fact that he has betrayed so many people and has actually done very little that has been productive in the best interest of American families."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/12/politics/kamala-harris-trump-green-cards-vilify-cnntv/index.html|title=Kamala Harris says Trump administration's move on green cards part of effort to 'vilify a whole group of people'|first=Kate|last=Sullivan|date=August 12, 2019|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

=== LGBT rights ===
[[File:Kamala Harris (48390414112).jpg|thumb|right|[[San Francisco Pride]], 2019]]
During her tenure as California Attorney General, Harris declined to defend the state's [[Same-sex marriage in California|ban on same-sex marriage]] in court. She supported the Obama administration's guidance supporting transgender students. Following the Supreme Court's overturning of the ban on same-sex marriage, she proceeded to conduct California's first same-sex marriage.<ref>{{cite video |title=Raw footage: Gay Marriage Resumes in California|publisher=Associated Press |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwEja24RALA |archive-date=June 28, 2013 }}</ref> Later on in 2015, she argued in court to withhold gender reassignment surgery from two transgender inmates who were prescribed the procedure while serving the sentences. This stance disappointed some LGBT rights advocates; she later stated that she only took that stance in court because her job required her to do so.<ref name=":10" />

As a member of the U.S. Senate, she co-sponsored the [[Equality Act (United States)|Equality Act]].<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|author=Chris Johnson|url=https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/10/25/kamala-harris-rises-as-lgbt-favorite-for-2020-theres-just-one-thing/|title=Kamala Harris rises as LGBT favorite for 2020{{snd}}there's just one thing|website=Washington Blade|date=October 25, 2017}}</ref>
=== Medical leave ===
On October 7, 2019, Harris unveiled a six months paid family and medical leave plan that included forming a new Office of Paid Family and Medical Leave that would oversee, determine eligibility and authorize benefit payments. Harris's paid leave program would be funded through general revenue and payroll contributions and establish a federal Bureau of Children and Family Justice. In a statement, Harris said the US will be brought "closer to economic justice for workers and ensures newborn children or children who are sick can get the care they need from a parent without thrusting the family into upheaval" via a six month paid leave guarantee.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/464683-harris-pitches-six-months-of-paid-family-medical-leave|title=Harris pitches six months of paid family, medical leave|first=Rebecca|last=Klar|date=October 7, 2019|publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

=== Net neutrality ===
In September 2017, Harris was one of nine senators to sign a letter to [[Federal Communications Commission]] Chairman [[Ajit Pai]] that charged the FCC with failing "to provide stakeholders with an opportunity to comment on the tens of thousands of filed complaints that directly shed light on proposed changes to existing net neutrality protections."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/technology/351785-senate-dems-ask-fcc-to-delay-net-neutrality-repeal|title=Senate Dems ask FCC to delay net neutrality repeal|first=Harper|last=Neidig|newspaper=The Hill|date=September 21, 2017}}</ref>

In March 2018, Harris was one of ten senators to sign a letter spearheaded by [[Jeff Merkley]] lambasting a proposal from FCC Chairman [[Ajit Pai]] that would curb the scope of benefits from the Lifeline program during a period where roughly 6.5 million people in poor communities relied on Lifeline to receive access to high-speed internet, citing that it was Pai's "obligation to the American public, as the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to improve the Lifeline program and ensure that more Americans can afford access, and have means of access, to broadband and phone service." The senators also advocated for insuring "Lifeline reaches more Americans in need of access to communication services."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/technology/380870-democrats-slam-fcc-head-over-plan-to-limit-internet-access-funding-for-low|title=Dems slam FCC head for proposed limits to low-income internet program|date=March 29, 2018|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>
=== Supreme Court ===
In a September 2019 letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, Harris called for the creation of a task force to investigate allegations against Associate Justice [[Brett Kavanaugh]] and look into whether Kavanaugh lied to Congress during his testimony the previous year as a Supreme Court nominee.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/461736-kamala-harris-calls-for-new-investigation-into-kavanaugh-allegations|title=Kamala Harris calls for new investigation into Kavanaugh allegations|first=Julia|last=Manchester|date=September 17, 2019|publisher=The Hill}}</ref> In October 2019, when asked whether she thought a president undergoing impeachment inquiries should be authorized to nominate Supreme Court justices, Harris replied, "That's a great question.

=== Taxes ===
Harris opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and has called for a repeal of the bill's tax cuts for wealthy Americans.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/11/15/almost-all-sen-harriss-trillion-tax-plan-would-help-middle-working-class-study-finds/|title=Almost all of Sen.

An analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that the bill would reduce federal revenue by $2.8 trillion over a decade.

=== Trade ===
In May 2019, Harris stated she would not have voted for the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) due to her belief that "we can do a better job to protect American workers" and called for the United States to do "a better job in terms of thinking about the priorities that should be more apparent now than perhaps they were then, which are issues like the climate crisis and what we need to build into these trade agreements."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/443314-kamala-harris-says-she-wouldnt-have-voted-for-nafta|title=Kamala Harris says she wouldn't have voted for NAFTA|date=May 12, 2019|first=Zack|last=Budryk|publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

=== Voting rights ===
In May 2019, Harris attributed the 2018 gubernatorial losses of [[Stacey Abrams]] and [[Andrew Gillum]], in both [[2018 Georgia gubernatorial election|Georgia]] and [[2018 Florida gubernatorial election|Florida]] to [[voter suppression]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-voter-suppression-abrams-gillum-1415903|title=Kamala Harris said that without voter suppression, Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum would've won their 2018 races|last=Hutzler|first=Alexandra|date=May 6, 2019|website=Newsweek}}</ref>
