'''Edward Colston''' (2 November 1636 – 11 October 1721) was a [[Bristol]]-born English [[slavery|slave]] trader, merchant and Member of Parliament. Much of his wealth, although used often for philanthropic purposes, was acquired through the [[Atlantic slave trade|trade and exploitation of slaves]].<ref>{{cite web

==Early life==
Colston was born on 2 November 1636 in Church Street, Bristol, the youngest of at least 15 children. His parents were William Colston (died 1681), a prosperous merchant who was [[High Sheriff of Bristol]] in 1643, and his wife Sarah (died 1701), daughter of Edward Batten. He was brought up in Bristol until the time of the [[English Civil War]], when he probably lived for a while on his father's estate in [[Winterbourne, South Gloucestershire|Winterbourne]], just north of the city. The family then moved to London where Edward may have been a pupil at [[Christ's Hospital]] school.<ref name="ODNB">{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5996 |title=Colston, Edward |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |last=Morgan |first=Kenneth |date=September 2004 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/5996 |accessdate=14 August 2010}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref>

==Career==
He was apprenticed to the [[Mercers Company]] for eight years and by 1672 was shipping goods from London. He built up a lucrative business, trading with Spain, [[Portugal]], Italy and Africa. In 1680, Colston became a member of the [[Royal African Company]], which had held the monopoly in [[Kingdom of England|Britain]] on trading in gold, [[ivory]] and [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]] from 1662.<ref name="ODNB" /> Colston rose rapidly on to the board of the company and became its deputy governor, its most senior executive position, in 1689.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/colston-edward-ii-1636-1721|title=COLSTON, Edward II (1636–1721), of Mortlake, Surr. {{!}} History of Parliament Online|website=www.historyofparliamentonline.org|access-date=16 November 2016}}</ref>

His parents had resettled in Bristol and in 1682 he made a loan to the Corporation, the following year becoming a member of the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] and a [[burgess (title)|burgess]] of the City. In 1684 he inherited his brother's mercantile business in Small Street, and was a partner in a sugar refinery in St. Peter's Churchyard, shipping sugar produced by slaves from [[St. Kitts]]. But he was never resident in Bristol, carrying on his London business from [[Mortlake]] in Surrey until he retired in 1708.<ref name="ODNB" />

==Altruism and politics==
[[File:CromwellHouseMortlake.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Cromwell House, [[Mortlake]], where Colston died in 1721]]
He founded [[almshouse]]s in King Street and on [[St. Michaels Hill]], endowed [[Queen Elizabeth's Hospital]] school{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} and helped found [[Colston's School|Colston's Hospital]], a boarding school which opened in 1710 leaving an endowment to be managed by the Society of Merchant Venturers for its upkeep. He gave money to schools in Temple (one of which went on to become [[St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School]]) and other parts of Bristol, and to several churches and the cathedral. He was a strong [[Tory]] and [[High church|high-churchman]], and was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol]] in 1710 for just one parliament.<ref name="ODNB" />

David Hughson writing in 1808 described Colston:
<blockquote>[Cromwell House was certainly the residence, in the last century, of] that excellent man Edward Colston, Esq. the great benefactor of the city of Bristol, who, in his lifetime, expended more than 10,000L. [£] in charitable institutions.''<ref name="hughson">{{cite book |last=Hughson |first=David |title=London; Being An Accurate History And Description of the British Metropolis And Its Neighbourhood, To Thirty Miles Extent, From An Actual Perambulation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g8wAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA386 |volume=V |year=1808 |publisher=J Stratford |location=Holborn Hill, London |page=386 |chapter=Circuit of London}}</ref></blockquote>

==Death==
He died on 11 October 1721 at his home, (old) Cromwell House (demolished 1857), in Mortlake. His body was carried back to Bristol and was buried at [[All Saints, Bristol|All Saints Church]]. His tomb was designed by [[James Gibbs]]. He died at the age of 84.<ref>{{cite web |title=Church of All Saints  |work=Images of England |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379381 |accessdate=16 March 2003}}</ref>

==Modern reappraisal==
[[Image:Edward Colston 1895 statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of Edward Colston in [[Bristol city centre]]]]
A statue, designed by [[John Cassidy (artist)|John Cassidy]], was erected in the centre of Bristol in 1895 commemorating Colston.<ref>{{cite web |title=Edward Colston |work=PMSA National Recording Project |url=http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/BL/BR09.htm |accessdate=9 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109153705/http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/BL/BR09.htm |archivedate=9 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1998, however, "someone scrawled on its base the name of one of the professions in which he made his fortune: SLAVE TRADER." <ref>{{cite book|last=Hochschild|first=Adam|title=Bury the Chains|year=2006|publisher=Mariner Books|location=New York City|pages=15}}</ref> He is a divisive figure in Bristolian civil society, viewed by some as an inspirational figure for the city, due to his donations of money to schools and other causes, but, in more recent times as Colston's activities as a major slave trader emerged, many in Bristol and beyond, now regard him as having committed crimes against humanity. Some have called for his statue to be taken down. In a poll in the local newspaper, the ''[[Bristol Post]]'', in 2014 just over half (56 per cent) of the 1,100 respondents said it should stay – 44 per cent wanted it to go.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bristol-torn-apart-over-statue-of-edward-colston-but-is-this-a-figure-of-shame-or-a-necessary-9555333.html|title=Bristol: Calls for statue of Edward Colston to be torn down|date=22 June 2014|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=16 November 2016}}</ref> Others called for a memorial plaque honouring the victims of slavery to be fitted to his statue. Bristol's first elected mayor, [[George Ferguson (architect)|George Ferguson]], stated on Twitter in 2013 that "Celebrations for Colston are perverse, not something I shall be taking part in!".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/bristol-mayor-city-s-celebration-edward-colston/story-19729958-detail/story.html|title=Bristol mayor: City's celebration of Edward Colston is|date=30 August 2013|newspaper=Bristol Post|access-date=16 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904091019/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-mayor-City-s-celebration-Edward-Colston/story-19729958-detail/story.html|archivedate=4 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Colston's name permeates the city in such landmarks as [[Colston Tower]], [[Colston Hall]], Colston Avenue, Colston Street, [[Colston's Girls' School]], [[Colston's School]], Colston's Primary School and Temple Colston School (now part of St Mary Redcliffe & Temple School). He is also remembered, particularly by some schools, charities and the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]], on Colston's Day on 13 November, his birthday, at a church service now at [[St Stephen's Church, Bristol|St Stephen's Church]]. A regional bread bun, the [[Colston bun]], is named after him.<ref name="ODNB" /><ref>{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Alan |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-211579-9 |page=114}}</ref>

In April 2017, the charity that runs the [[Colston Hall]] announced that it will drop the name of Colston when it reopens after reburbishment in 2020.  There had been protests and petitions calling for a name change and some concertgoers and artists had boycotted the venue because of the Colston name.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/26/bristol-colston-hall-to-drop-name-of-slave-trader-after-protests|title=Bristol's Colston Hall to drop name of slave trader after protests|date=26 April 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB}}</ref>
