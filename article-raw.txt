In February 1998, [[San Francisco District Attorney's Office|San Francisco District Attorney]], [[Terence Hallinan]], recruited Harris as an Assistant District Attorney.<ref name="Head">{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29091340/sf-examiner-feb-03-1998/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200422133402/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29091340/sf-examiner-feb-03-1998/ |url-status=live |title=DA Names New Head of Career Crime Unit|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=February 3, 1998|archive-date=April 22, 2020 }}</ref> She became the chief of the Career Criminal Division, supervising five other attorneys,<ref name="Karma" /> where she prosecuted [[homicide]], [[burglary]], [[robbery]] and [[sexual assault]] cases{{snd}}particularly [[Three-strikes law|Three-Strikes cases]].<ref name="Karma" /> Harris was noted as having been "an excellent mentor" in the office, and had been active in Hallinan's 1999 re-election campaign through his December election.

Harris reportedly clashed with Hallinan's new chief assistant, Darrell Salomon<ref name="Quits" /><ref name="TopAide">{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Hartlaub|title=DA's top aide quits among turmoil|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|date=August 21, 2000}}</ref> Salomon's appointment coincided with the introduction of a [[2000 California Proposition 21|Prop 21]], which would grant prosecutors the option of trying [[Minor (law)|juvenile]] defendants in Superior Court rather than juvenile courts, authority usually only reserved for judges.<ref name="Kayo">{{cite news |url=https://www.theava.com/archives/96387 |last=Fred |first=Gardener|title=Kamala vs. Kayo (2003)|work=[[Anderson Valley Advertiser]]|location=Boonville, CA |publisher=Bruce Anderson, editor and publisher |date=February 13, 2019}}</ref> Harris, concerned about the possibility of nearly 40,000 minority kids per year being tried in adult court, became involved in campaigning against the measure, attending rallies as a speaker, writing position papers and volunteering for the "No-On-21" campaign on weekends.<ref name=Kayo/> Her knowledge and commitment to the issue was such that the District Attorney's Public Information Officer, Fred Gardner, would give reporters the option to interview both Harris and Hallinan, who also opposed the measure.<ref name=Kayo/>

Salomon approached Gardner and ordered him to stop directing Prop 21 media inquiries to Harris. Gardner asked her if she was planning to run in 2003, to which Harris replied that it would be "unprofessional" to run against Hallinan if he decided to run for a third term.<ref name=Kayo/> Gardner relayed Harris' response to Hallinan.<ref name=Kayo/> However, Hallinan ordered that all calls from reporters go directly to him. He then retaliated and reassigned Harris, which she believed to be a ''[[de facto]]'' demotion.

Harris inherited a dismal 50.3% felony conviction rate from Hallinan when she took over in 2004.

While Harris oversaw more than 1900 convictions for marijuana possession, lawyers working in her office stated that most defendants for low-level possession were never even charged with a crime, consistent with the city and county's low enforcement priorities. Only 45 people were sentenced to state prison for marijuana trafficking.<ref>{{cite news|first=Casey|last=Tolan|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/09/11/kamala-harris-prosecuting-marijuana-cases/|title=Campaign fact check: Here’s how Kamala Harris really prosecuted marijuana cases|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>In 2010, it was reported that [[San Francisco Police Department]] crime lab technician Deborah Madden had been taking home samples of cocaine from the lab, possibly tainting evidence for hundreds of pending criminal prosecutions.

Maryland]].'' [[SFPD]] had been reluctant to disclose Madden's personnel files, making it difficult for Harris' office to substantiate allegations with evidence.  Harris took the remedial step of dismissing a number of drug-related cases, including many in which convictions had already been obtained, that could have been compromised by [[SFPD]]'s technician. <ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Kranish|url=

==== Violent crimes====
[[File:Kamala Harris photo May 20.jpg|thumb|Kamala Harris as SFDA]]
In the early 2000s, the [[City and County of San Francisco]] murder rate per capita drastically outpaced the national average. Within the first six months of taking office, Harris cleared 27 of 74 backlogged homicide cases by settling 14 by [[plea bargain]] and taking 11 to trial; with 9 convictions and 2 hung juries, she attained an 81% success rate.

Harris also pushed for higher bail for criminal [[defendant]]s involved in gun-related crimes, arguing that historically low [[bail]] encouraged outsiders to commit crimes in San Francisco. [[San Francisco Police Department|SFPD officers]] credited Harris with tightening [[loophole]]s in bail and drug programs that defendants had used in the past.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jaxon|last=Van Derbeken|url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Trials-and-tribulations-of-Kamala-Harris-D-A-2521498.php |title=Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A. / 2 years into term, prosecutor, police have their differences|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=March 20, 2006|accessdate=March 9, 2019}}</ref> In addition to creating a gun crime unit, Harris opposed releasing defendants on their own recognizance if they were arrested on gun crimes, sought minimum 90-day sentences for possession of concealed or loaded weapons, and charged all assault weapons possession cases as felonies, adding that she would seek prison terms for criminals who possess or use assault weapons and maximum penalties on gun-related crimes:<ref name="Garofoli">{{cite news|last=Garofoli|first=Joe |url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/joegarofoli/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-D-A-vows-to-go-after-gun-law-2755194.php |title=SAN FRANCISCO / D.A. vows to go after gun law violators / Harris takes tough approach, pledges maximum penalties|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=May 29, 2004|accessdate=May 2, 2020}}</ref>

In 2004, Harris created a new unit in the district attorney's office dedicated to prosecuting child assault crimes, staffed by prosecutors already assigned to the sexual assault detail.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jaxon|last=Van Derbeken|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=107007E1EB4A3010&p_docnum=10&s_dlid=DL0120050202495811073&s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&s_trackval=&s_siteloc=&s_referrer=&s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F15%2F2030&s_docsbal=%20&s_subexpires=12%2F15%2F2030&s_docstart=&s_docsleft=&s_docsread=&s_username=refuser&s_accountid=AC0114070818394531470&s_upgradeable=no|title=D.A. creating unit to fight child assaults|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=December 15, 2004|accessdate=May 1, 2020}}</ref> 

In April 2005, Harris pursued the prosecution of Charles Rothenberg a.k.a. Charley Charles, under California's [[three strikes law]] for illegal possession of a firearm. Rothenberg became infamous in the 1980s when he set his 6-year-old son, [[Dave Dave]], on fire amidst a custody dispute with his ex-wife.

In August 2007, State Assemblyman [[Mark Leno]] introduced legislation to ban gun shows at the [[Cow Palace]] joined by Harris, Police Chief [[Heather Fong]] and Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]]. City leaders contended the shows were directly contributing to the proliferation of illegal guns and spiking homicide rates in San Francisco: Mayor Newsom earlier that month signed into law local legislation banning gun shows on city and county property. Leno alleged that gun merchants drove through the public housing developments nearby and illegally sold weapons to residents.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marisa |last=Lagos |url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Measure-would-ban-gun-shows-at-Cow-Palace-2526741.php |title=Measure would ban gun shows at Cow Palace

In 2008, Harris again worked with Assemblyman Leno to draft legislation that provided young bystanders to violent crime up to $5,000 in mental health services. A.B. 2809, allowed child witnesses access funding from the state's Victim Compensation Program for treatment of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Harris said: "For too many children, seeing shootings or stabbings in their neighborhoods is far too common. Before this law, there was no help." Leno's bill was signed into law by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Jill|last=Tucker|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=12391D794AF851B0&p_docnum=24&s_dlid=DL0120050216352427816&s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&s_trackval=&s_siteloc=&s_referrer=&s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F15%2F2030&s_docsbal=%20&s_subexpires=12%2F15%2F2030&s_docstart=&s_docsleft=&s_docsread=&s_username=refuser&s_accountid=AC0114070818394531470&s_upgradeable=no|title=State to aid young witnesses of violent crime|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 2, 2008|accessdate=May 2, 2020}}</ref>

===Reform efforts===
====Recidivism and re-entry initiative====
[[File:Back on Track Graduation (4154861372).jpg|thumb|Back on Track Graduation]]
In 2004, Harris recruited civil rights activist [[Lateefah Simon]], the youngest woman to ever receive a [[MacArthur Fellowship]], to create San Francisco Reentry Division. The flagship program was the Back on Track initiative, a first-of-its-kind reentry program for nonviolent, first-time offenders age 18–30. Initiative participants whose crimes were not weapon or gang-related would plead guilty in exchange for a deferral of sentencing and regular appearances before a judge over a 12 to 18-month period. The program maintained rigorous graduation requirements, mandating completion of up to 220 hours of community service, obtaining a [[High school equivalency degree|high-school-equivalency diploma]], maintaining steady employment, taking parenting classes, and passing drug tests. At graduation, the court would dismiss the case and expunge the graduate's record.<ref name="Fraley">{{cite web|first=Malaika|last=Fraley|url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2009/10/26/book-em-kamala-s-f-district-attorney-harris-adds-author-to-list-of-credits/|title=Book 'em, Kamala{{snd}}S.F.

Over six years, Harris' pioneer program produced over 200 graduates, and achieved a low [[recidivism]] rate of less than 10 percent, compared to 53 percent of California's drug offenders that returned to prison within two years of release. Back on Track earned recognition from the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] as a model for reentry programs. The DOJ found that the cost to the taxpayers per participant was markedly lower ($5,000) than the cost of adjudicating a case ($10,000) and housing a low-level offender ($50,000).<ref>{{cite web | url=

====Refusal to seek the death penalty====
Harris made a campaign pledge to never seek the death penalty as a prosecutor.<ref name="sfgate.com"/> In April 2004, [[San Francisco Police Department]] Officer Isaac Espinoza was shot and killed in the line of duty. Three days later, Harris announced she would not seek the [[death penalty]], angering the [[San Francisco Police Officers Association]]. Harris's decision attracted the support of Attorney General [[Bill Lockyer]] and San Francisco Supervisors [[Tom Ammiano]] and [[Sophie Maxwell]], in whose district the murder occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basetree.com/photos/sets/photography39.html |title=Don't Kill in Our Name, Rally to Support Kamala Harris |website=Basetree |date=May 5, 2004 |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> During Espinoza's funeral at [[Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption (San Francisco, California)|St. Mary's Cathedral]], U.S. Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] and former Mayor of San Francisco, in a surprise move, rose to the pulpit and called on Harris, who was sitting in the front pew, to seek the death penalty, prompting a standing ovation from the 2,000 uniformed police officers in attendance. Immediately thereafter, Association President Gary Delagnes echoed her call and demanded that Espinoza's killer "pay the ultimate price." <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Feinstein-s-surprise-call-for-death-penalty-puts-3313728.php |title=Feinstein's surprise call for death penalty puts D.A. on spot|website=San Francisco Chronicle |date=April 21, 2004 |accessdate=May 3, 2020}}</ref> Despite immense political pressure from members of California's political establishment, including U.S. Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] and Oakland Mayor [[Jerry Brown]], Harris still refused.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Sen-Boxer-joins-throng-calling-for-death-in-3324378.php |title=Sen.

Harris's convictions were tested again in the case of [[Edwin Ramos]], an [[illegal immigrant]] and alleged [[MS-13]] gang member who was accused of murdering Tony Bologna and his sons Michael and Matthew. On September 10, 2009, she announced she would seek life in prison without the possibility of parole, a decision Mayor Gavin Newsom backed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Van Derbeken |first=Jaxon |url=https://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Edwin-Ramos-won-t-face-death-penalty-3218429.php |title=Edwin Ramos won't face death penalty |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=September 11, 2009 |accessdate=April 22, 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/16/BANU19NGA7.DTL|title=Newsom backs Harris' decision|last=Knight|first=Heather|last2=Lagos|first2=Marisa|date=2009-09-16|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref>

====Truancy initiative====
In 2006, as part of an initiative to reduce the city skyrocketing homicide rate, Harris led a city-wide effort to combat [[truancy]] for at-risk elementary school youth in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Heather|last=Knight|title=City opens campaign to cut truancy by thousands of students|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=105D3AF9CE92404E&p_docnum=16&s_dlid=DL0120050214473400976&s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&s_trackval=&s_siteloc=&s_referrer=&s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F15%2F2030&s_docsbal=%20&s_subexpires=12%2F15%2F2030&s_docstart=&s_docsleft=&s_docsread=&s_username=refuser&s_accountid=AC0114070818394531470&s_upgradeable=no|accessdate=May 1, 2020 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 19, 2004}}</ref> Declaring chronic truancy a matter of public safety and pointing out that the majority of prison inmates and homicide victims are dropouts or habitual truants, Harris' office met with thousands of parents at high-risk schools and sent out letters warning all families of the legal consequences of truancy at the beginning of the fall semester, adding she would prosecute the parents of chronically truant elementary students: penalties included a $2,500 fine and up to a year in jail.<ref name="Knight">{{cite news|first=Heather|last=Knight|title=City trying to get worst truants to school.

In 2008, Harris issued citations against six parents whose children missed at least 50 days of school, the first time [[San Francisco]] prosecuted adults for student truancy. San Francisco's school chief, Carlos Garcia, stated that the path from truancy to parental prosecution was lengthy, and that the school district usually spends months encouraging parents to send their children to school through phone calls, reminder letters, private meetings, hearings before the School Attendance Review Board, and offers of help from city agencies and social services; two of the six parents entered no plea but said they would work with the DA's office and social service agencies to create "parental responsibility plans" to help them start sending their children to school regularly.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nanette|last=Asimov|title=Citations go to parents of truant kids|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=1213DEC077C76F28&p_docnum=9&s_dlid=DL0120050214581526325&s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&s_trackval=&s_siteloc=&s_referrer=&s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F15%2F2030&s_docsbal=%20&s_subexpires=12%2F15%2F2030&s_docstart=&s_docsleft=&s_docsread=&s_username=refuser&s_accountid=AC0114070818394531470&s_upgradeable=no|accessdate=May 2, 2020 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 11, 2008}}</ref>

By the end of April 2009, there were 1,330 elementary school students who were habitual or chronic truants, down from 1,730 in 2008, 2,517 in 2007 and 2,856 in 2006. This amounted to a staggering 23% drop since the 2005–06 school year.

On November 12, 2008, Harris announced her candidacy for [[California Attorney General]].

In the general election, she faced Republican [[Los Angeles County]] District Attorney [[Steve Cooley]], who led most of the race. Cooley ran as a nonpartisan, distancing himself from the [[2010 California gubernatorial election|Meg Whitman campaign]]. However, during a debate on October 5, Cooley complained about the low salary of the attorney general, stating his intention to accept a pension and the salary in a practice known as "double-dipping." Harris' turned his remarks into a cutting political ad that portrayed him as out-of-touch. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.laweekly.com/how-steve-cooley-blew-it-the-definitive-post-mortem/ |first=Gene |last=Maddaus |title=HOW STEVE COOLEY BLEW IT: THE DEFINITIVE POST-MORTEM|work=LA Weekly|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref>

In 2011, after she was elected Attorney General, Harris urged criminal penalties for parents of truant children as she did as District Attorney of San Francisco, allowing the court to defer judgment if the parent agreed to a mediation period to get their child back in school. Critics charged that local prosecutors implementing her directives were overzealous in their enforcement and that Harris' rhetoric legitimized the notion that parents were responsible for their children's education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-truancy-arrests-2020-progressive-prosecutor_n_5c995789e4b0f7bfa1b57d2e|title=IThe Human Costs Of Kamala Harris’ War On Truancy|first=Molly|last=Redden|date=March 29, 2019|website=HuffPost|accessdate=May 25, 2020}}</ref>

In 2013, Harris issued a report titled "In School + On Track," which found that more than 250,000 elementary school students in the state were "chronically absent," meaning they missed 18 or more days of school. The report found that the statewide truancy rate for elementary students in the 2012–2013 school year was nearly 30%, at a cost of nearly $1.4 billion to school districts since funding is based on attendance rates. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/tr/truancy_2013.pdf|title=In School + On Track: Attorney General's 2013 Report on California's Elementary School Truancy and Absenteeism Crisis|website=California Attorney General|accessdate=May 25, 2020}}</ref>

In 2014, Harris called on several major law firms and corporate lawyers from [[Walt Disney Co.]] and [[Warner Bros. Entertainment]] to provide ''pro bono'' services to unaccompanied immigrant children flooding the U.S. border with Mexico, requesting up to 500 hours of volunteer services. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-california-immigration/california-attorney-general-asks-lawyers-to-help-immigrant-children-idUSKBN0FU02020140725|title=California attorney general asks lawyers to help immigrant children
|last=Bernstein|first=Sharon|date=July 24, 2014|website=Reuters|location=Sacramento|accessdate=May 25, 2020}}</ref>That year, Harris advocated for a package of bills she sponsored in the California legislature to help prevent truancy, such as the creation of local attendance review boards and instituting a statewide attendance data system for students. Harris emphasized that school absences have cost California public schools nearly $3.5 billion in funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/california-attorney-general-kamala-harris-visits-los-angeles-elementary-school-to-talk-about-efforts-to-curb-truancy/65187/|title=Curbing Truancy Focus of California Attorney General’s LA Visit|last1=Truong|first1=Kevin|last2=Baldonado|first2=Kim|date=August 12, 2014|website=NBC Los Angeles|location=Los Angeles|accessdate=May 25, 2020}}</ref>Governor [[Jerry Brown]] later signed into law two of the bills in the package – one adding a representative of the local district attorney’s office and public defender’s office to school attendance review boards and another require prosecutors to report the outcome of adjudicated truancy cases to local authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-brown-truancy-20140930-story.html/|title=Brown splits package of bills aimed at reducing truancy

In 2015, Harris announced that she would start a new agency called the Bureau of Children's Justice to address issues such as [[foster care]], the juvenile justice system, school [[truancy]], and childhood trauma. She appointed special assistant attorney general Jill Habig to head the agency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/news/kamala-harris-bureau-of-childrens-justice-taking-shape/9513|title=Kamala Harris' Bureau of Children's Justice Takes Shape|last=Heimpel|first=Daniel|date=February 28, 2015|website=The Chronicle of Social Change|location=San Francisco|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> Harris released the 2015 draft of In School + On Track, which reported that public awareness of the issue has increased, while districts have improved their monitoring and tracking techniques. 82% of districts reported changes to their data collection, while more than 60% of district reported they have changed their alert systems to track a student's attendance history; 95% of all surveyed school districts reported they have made changes to improve attendance. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/tr/truancy_2015.pdf|title=In School + On Track 2015 |website=California Attorney General|accessdate=May 25, 2020}}</ref>

In 2016, Harris announced a $168.5 million settlement with K-12, Inc., an online charter school, over claims it engaged in false advertising and inflated the academic progress of its students. The corporation received more than $310 million in state funding for its profitable but poorly performing online charter schools, which served about 15,000 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/da673fdbf02f40ce8a4fc0403a605fb8|title=Online school operator agrees to $168.5M settlement

====Criminal justice reform  ====
In November 2013, Harris launched the [[California Department of Justice]]'s Division of Recidivism Reduction and Re-Entry in partnership with district attorney offices in [[San Diego]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Alameda County]]. Building off Back on Track, the division was formed to develop a consistent definition of recidivism, allocate grants for programs, and creating metrics through the use of data.<ref>{{cite web|first=Rina|last=Palta|url=https://www.scpr.org/news/2013/11/20/40494/attorney-general-kamala-harris-announces-new-divis/|title=Calif. Attorney General Kamala Harris announces new division to stop ex-prisoners from committing new crimes|accessdate=May 22, 2020|date=November 20, 2013}}</ref> In November 2014, Harris announced $750,000 grant in federal funds for her program through the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]'s [[Second Chance Act (2007)]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://jailstojobs.org/back-on-track-la-receives-second-chance-act-funding/|title=Back on Track LA receives Second Chance Act funding
|accessdate=May 29, 2020|date=November 21, 2014}}</ref> In March 2015, Harris announced the creation of a pilot program in coordination with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department called "Back on Track LA." Like Back on Track, individuals participating in the pilot program for 24–30 months, and included non-serious, non-violent and non-sexual criminal offenders between 18 and 30. Assigned a case manager, participants received education through a partnership with the [[Los Angeles Community College District]] and job training services.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sheriff, AG Harris Unveil Program to Curb Recidivism|url=https://scvnews.com/sheriff-ag-harris-unveil-program-to-curb-recidivism/|first=Alex |last=Veiga |agency=SCV News|date=Mar 11, 2015}}</ref> An assessment of the Back on Track LA pilot program by the [[American Society of Criminology]] found that graduates showed significantly higher self-esteem and decision-making ability, lower levels of depression, entitlement, criminal rationalization, justification of antisocial behavior, and personal irresponsibility compared to the control group. On balance, the results showed that Back on Track LA was effective in showing significant decrease on general propensity for recidivism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/research/bot-la-2018-ASC.pdf|title=Program Evaluation: Back on Track–LA |accessdate=May 9, 2020|date=2018}}</ref>

Harris' record on [[wrongful conviction]] cases as Attorney General has engendered some criticism from academics and activists. For example, law professor Lara Bazelon contends Harris “weaponized technicalities” to uphold lengthy sentences. <ref>{{cite web|first=Lara|last=Bazelon|url=https://theappeal.org/kamala-harris-criminal-justice-record-killed-her-presidential-run/|title=KAMALA HARRIS’S CRIMINAL JUSTICE RECORD KILLED HER PRESIDENTIAL RUN|work=The Appeal|date=December 4, 2019}}</ref>However, subsequent review by appellate courts have largely vindicated Harris on both substantive and procedural grounds. For example, in 2014, Judge [[Cormac J. Carney]] vacated the death sentence of convicted rapist and murderer Ernest Dewayne Jones, declaring [[capital punishment in California]] unconstitutional on the basis of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]'s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment because "systemic delay and dysfunction" rendered the process arbitrary. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/Why-does-Kamala-Harris-defend-the-death-penalty-6481227.php|title=Why does Kamala Harris defend the death penalty?|publisher=}}</ref> Harris appealed, contending Carney failed to abide by the highly-circumscribed [[habeas corpus]] procedure set forth in the binding Supreme Court precedent of ''[[Teague v. Lane]]'' prohibiting federal courts from announcing a new rule of constitutional law in habeas cases. <ref>489 U.S. 288 (1989)</ref>The [[9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] sided with Harris when it unanimously overturned Carney’s order. <ref>''Jones. v. Davis'' 806 F.3d 538, 545 (9th Cir. 2015)</ref>

In 2015, criminal justice advocates contended that the L.A. District Attorney violated so-called [[Brady v. Maryland|''Brady'' rule]] when they withheld exculpatory evidence from defense counsel in the prosecution of electrician George Gage for sexual abuse of a child. <ref>373 U.S. 83 (1963)</ref>Gage filed a petition for habeas relief to the [[California Court of Appeal]] on the basis of these violations, which was denied for “failure to demonstrate that there is any merit to any of his constitutional contentions,” and summarily upheld by the [[California Supreme Court]]. <ref>''Gage v. Chappell'' 793 F.3d 1159, 1164 (9th Cir. 2015)</ref>Then in 2005, Gage filed another petition in federal district court focused on procedural defects unrelated to the ''Brady'' violations. <ref>''Id.'' at 1165</ref>Again, the petition was denied by the federal district court and upheld by the [[9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] in 2014. <ref>''Id.''</ref> In his third application before the 9th Circuit, which Harris argued should be denied on procedural grounds, a three judge panel unanimously held that Gage’s third appeal was prohibited under the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]], barring second or successive petitions for habeas relief. <ref>''Id.'' at 1169</ref>

====Law enforcement accountability  ====
In 2014, after a rash of racially motivated police killings nationwide, Harris conducted a 90-day review of [[implicit bias]] and lethal use of force. In April 2015, Harris introduced the first of its kind "''Principled Policing: Procedural Justice and Implicit Bias''" training, designed in conjunction with [[Stanford University]] psychologist and professor [[Jennifer Eberhardt]], to help law enforcement officers overcome barriers to neutral policing and rebuild the relationship of trust between law enforcement and the community. All Command-level staff received the training. The training was part of a package of reforms introduced within the [[California Department of Justice]], which also included additional resources deployed to increase the recruitment and hiring of diverse special agents, an expanded role for the department to investigate officer-related shooting investigations, and community policing. <ref>{{cite news |title=California: Kamala Harris announces police anti-bias training program|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/04/17/california-kamala-harris-announces-police-anti-bias-training-program/|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]] |date=April 17, 2015|accessdate=April 30, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=California Attorney General Launches Top-Down Policing Reforms|url=https://www.kqed.org/news/10493776/california-attorney-general-launches-top-down-policing-reforms|work=[[KQED]] |date=April 17, 2015|accessdate=May 29, 2020}}</ref>

In 2015, Harris' [[California Department of Justice]] was the first statewide agency in the country to require all of its police officers to wear [[body cameras]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/live-updates/general-election/fact-checking-the-first-democratic-debate/harris-on-requiring-police-to-wear-body-cameras/?arc404=true|title=Harris on requiring police to wear body cameras|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 27, 2019}}</ref> Harris said she believed that all officers should wear cameras, but did not believe in imposing statewide standards to regulate the use of body cameras, cautioning against a "one-size-fits-all" solution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-harris-body-cameras-20150527-story.html|title=Kamala Harris cautions against ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach on body cameras|work=[[LA Times]]|date=May 27, 2015}}</ref>Harris was later criticized by criminal justice advocates for her measured approach. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Kamala-Harris-takes-measured-approach-to-probing-7955937.php|title=Kamala Harris takes measured approach to probing SF cop shootings|work=[[SF Chronicle]]|date=June 1, 2016}}</ref>That same year, Harris announced a new state law requiring every law enforcement agency in California to collect, report, and publish expanded statistics on how many people are shot, seriously injured or killed by peace officers throughout the state<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kqed.org/news/10813726/state-to-improve-police-use-of-force-data-next-year-under-new-law-2|title=State to Improve Police Use-of-Force Data Next Year Under New Law|work=[[KQED]]|date=December 30, 2015}}</ref>

Later that year, Harris appealed a judge's order to take over the prosecution of a [[2011 Seal Beach shooting|high-profile mass murder case]] and to eject all 250 prosecutors from the Orange County District Attorney's office over allegations of misconduct by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] D.A. [[Tony Rackauckas]]. Rackauckas was alleged to have illegally employed jailhouse informants and concealed evidence.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sidney |last=Powell |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/scott-dekraai-case_n_6911258|title=California AG Appeals Booting Of Orange County DA From Mass Murder Case Over Misconduct Allegations|date=October 17, 2016|website=HuffPost|accessdate=May 1, 2020}}</ref> Harris noted that it was unnecessary to ban all 250 prosecutors from working on the case, as only a few had been directly involved, later promising a narrower criminal investigation. The [[U.S. Department of Justice]] began an investigation into Rackauckas in December 2016, but he was not re-elected. His successor, Republican [[Todd Spitzer]] later stated his office willing to undergo federal probation to end the investigation.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tony |last=Saavedra |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2019/02/25/new-orange-county-da-willing-to-undergo-federal-probation-to-end-snitch-investigation/|title=New Orange County DA willing to undergo federal probation to end 'snitch' investigation|date=February 25, 2019|website=TheOCRegister|accessdate=May 1, 2020}}</ref>

In 2016, Harris announced a massive patterns and practices investigation into purported civil rights violations and use of [[excessive force]] by the two largest law enforcement agencies in [[Kern County, California]], the [[Bakersfield Police Department]] and the [[Kern County Sheriff's Department]]. <ref>{{cite news |first1=Oliver |last1=Laughland|first2=Jon|last2=Swaine|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/22/california-police-kern-county-investigation-kamala-harris|title=Two 'deadliest' police departments in US to be investigated in California|date=December 22, 2016|website=The Guardian|accessdate=May 29, 2020}}</ref>Labelled the "deadliest police departments in America" in a five-part [[Guardian]] expose, a separate investigation commissioned by the [[ACLU]] and submitted to the [[California Department of Justice]] corroborated reports of police using [[excessive force]]. The ACLU found that  officers had engaged in patterns of excessive force – including shooting and beating to death unarmed individuals – as well as a practice of filing retaliatory criminal charges against individuals subjected to excessive force. Further analysis also revealed the highest rate of police homicides in the country, as well as excessive use of force resulting in 17 deaths of unarmed civilians from 2009 to 2013 in the form of dog attacks and tazings. <ref>{{cite news |first1=Oliver |last1=Laughland|first2=Jon|last2=Swaine|url=https://www.kqed.org/news/11631037/aclu-report-slams-central-valley-law-enforcement-agencies|title=ACLU says violence at Kern County police departments violated rights|date=November 9, 2017|website=The Guardian|accessdate=May 29, 2020}}</ref>

====LGBTQ rights====
{{main|Hollingsworth v. Perry}}
In 2008, California voters passed [[2008 California Proposition 8|Prop 8]], a [[California ballot proposition]] and a state constitutional amendment defining marriage between a man and a woman. Legal challenges to Prop 8 were presented by opponents quickly after its approval, and a pair of same-sex couples filed a lawsuit against the initiative in federal court in the case of [[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]] (later [[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]).

In August 2010, Chief Judge [[Vaughn Walker]] ruled that the amendment was unconstitutional under both the [[Due Process Clause|Due Process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] Clauses of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Judge strikes down Prop. 8, allows gay marriage in California |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/08/prop8-gay-marriage.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}</ref> since it purported to ''re-remove'' rights from a disfavored class only, with no [[Rational basis review|rational basis]].

On February 7, 2012, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]], in a 2–1 decision, reached the same conclusion as the district court, but on narrower grounds. The court ruled that it was unconstitutional for California to grant marriage rights to same-sex couples, only to take them away shortly after. The ruling was stayed pending appeal to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].<ref name="auto16">http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2012/02/07/1016696com.pdf</ref>The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] granted [[certiorari]] that December, ordering the parties to brief and argue the additional question of whether supporters of Prop. 8 have standing, i.e., a legal right to be involved in the case, under Article III, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution.<ref name="auto16"/> On February 27, 2013, Harris filed an [[amicus curiae]] brief, arguing that Prop 8 was unconstitutional and that initiative's sponsors did not have [[legal standing]] to represent California's interests by defending the law in federal court.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-files-us-supreme-court-brief-support-marriage |title=Attorney General Kamala D.

On June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, ruled that the proponents did not possess [[Standing (law)|legal standing]] in their own right to defend Prop 8 in [[United States federal courts|federal court]], either to the Supreme Court or (previously) to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]].

In 2012, [[conversion therapy|conversion therapists]] filed two lawsuits, ''Pickup v. Brown'' (12-17681) and ''Welch v.

====Elder abuse====
In 2013, Harris announced she had secured a three-year prison sentence in state prison for a nursing director who inappropriately medicated elderly patients at a [[Kern County]] nursing home. The nursing director pled guilty to one count of felony [[elder abuse]] that resulted in the death of one victim. The Defendant was alleged to sedated 23 elderly patients suffering from [[Alzheimers]] or dementia simply to keep them quiet; all suffered adverse physical reactions. <ref>{{cite news |title=Woman Sentenced For Nursing Home Death|url=https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/01/09/woman-sentenced-for-nursing-home-death//|accessdate=May 28, 2020 |work=CBS Los Angeles |date=January 9, 2013}}</ref>That same year, Harris also forced a settlement with Skilled Healthcare Group, Inc. to resolve allegations that the nursing home operator endangered the elderly charges under its care. Under the agreement, the nursing home chain was required to improve its staffing levels and quality of care at its 20 facilities in Los Angeles. <ref>{{cite news |first=Grant Scott|Last=Go-Forth|title=Skilled Healthcare settles; agreement requires improved staffing|url=

In 2013, Harris also obtained a 42 year prison sentence for the operator of a massive [[Ponzi scheme]] that defrauded mostly elderly investors out of more than $90 million. <ref>{{cite news |title=State hits hard on financial crimes|url=https://www.theunion.com/news/local-news/state-hits-hard-on-financial-crimes/|accessdate=May 28, 2020 |work=The Union |date=August 2, 2013}}</ref>In 2014, Harris announced a 20 year prison sentence with Sonoma County D.A.

====Fraud, waste, and abuse====
In 2011, Harris won a court order reviving a state fraud lawsuit against [[CalPERS]] board member Alfred J.R. Villalobos and former CalPERS chief executive Federico Buenrosto, Jr. after they declared bankruptcy to avoid charges. Villalobos was alleged to have been paid more than $47 million in commissions to help private equity firms steer contracts to manage $4.8 billion worth of assets from 2005 to 2009.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fraud case against Alfred Villalobos is revived|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-jul-08-la-fi-calpers-villalobos-20110708-story.html|first=Marc |last=Lifsher |newspaper=[[LA Times]]|date=July 8, 2011}}</ref> By 2014, Villalobos and Buenrosto were indicted in federal court on bribery and corruption charges in connection with an influence operation regarding CalPERS's investment decisions.

In 2012, Harris leveraged California's outsize economic clout as the world's fifth largest economy to obtain better terms in the [[2010 United States foreclosure crisis|National Mortgage Settlement]] against the nation's five largest banks – [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Bank of America]], [[Wells Fargo]], [[Citigroup]] and [[Ally Bank]].<ref name="Parker">{{cite news | url=https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Kamala-Harris-foreclosure-deal-a-win-for-state-3381270.php |title=Kamala Harris' foreclosure deal a win for state |date=March 5, 2012 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |last=Parker |first=Barbara |first2=Rebecca |last2=Kaplan |accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> In her memoir, ''The Truths We Hold,'' Harris said that initial negotiations had yielded an offer that amounted to "crumbs," or $2 to $4 billion in relief for California residents.<ref>(Harris, 2019) pg. 95</ref> Harris indicated she was prepared to pull out of the negotiations if the banks weren't willing to increase their offer.

In 2013, Harris declined to file a civil enforcement action against future [[U.S. Treasury Secretary]] [[Steve Mnuchin]] (then a private citizen) and his bank [[OneWest]] despite evidence "suggestive of widespread misconduct." While investigators in Harris' office recommended filing an action against the bank, they warned that such an action would result in OneWest, a federally chartered bank, to assert that the state claims would be pre-empted by federal regulations imposed by the [[Dodd-Frank Act]], triggering prolonged and costly litigation at taxpayer expense.<ref name="auto2">{{cite news |title=Kamala Harris has complicated history with Wall Street |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/26/kamala-harris-has-complicated-history-with-wall-street.html |first=Carmin |last=Chappell |publisher=CNBC |date=January 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3250383-OneWest-Package-Memo.html|title=Executive Summary – Request for Authorization to File Action against OneWest Bank, FSB OneWest Investigation (SF20122105513)|date=January 18, 2013|work=California Department of Justice}}</ref> With the law against them and protracted litigation anticipated, Harris exercised [[prosecutorial discretion]] by declining to pursue further action.<ref>{{cite news|first=Carmin|last=Chappell|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/26/kamala-harris-has-complicated-history-with-wall-street.html|title=Kamala Harris' Complicated History with Wall Street will come under scrutiny in the 2020 race|publisher=CNBC|date=January 26, 2019}}</ref> In 2017, she said that her office's decision was based on "following the facts and the evidence...like any other case."<ref>{{cite web|first=Sylvan|last=Lane|url=https://thehill.com/policy/finance/312742-senate-democrat-defends-decision-not-to-charge-trump-treasury-pick-over |title=Dem defends decision not to charge Trump Treasury pick over foreclosures|newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=January 4, 2017}}</ref> Harris' press secretary later noted correctly that the state attorney general's office was also hampered by an inability to issue subpoenas due to [[OneWest Bank]]'s status as a federally chartered bank.<ref name="auto2"/> Binding [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] precedent have consistently held that "[...] state laws that conflict with federal law are 'without effect'"<ref>''Maryland v.

Harris was highly successful when she pursued financial recoveries for California's public employee and teacher's pensions, [[CalPERS]] and [[CalSTRS]] against various financial giants for misrepresentation in the sale of [[mortgage-backed securities]].

====Law enforcement improvements====
[[File:Attorney General Kamala D. Harris Tours the Fresno Regional DNA Laboratory.jpg|thumb|AG Harris Touring the Fresno Regional DNA Laboratory]]
California's [[2004 California Proposition 69|Proposition 69]] mandated law enforcement to collect DNA samples from any adult arrested for a felony and from individuals arrested for certain crimes. In 2012, Harris announced that the [[California Department of Justice]] had improved its DNA testing capabilities such that samples stored at the state's crime labs could now be analyzed four times faster, within 30 days. Accordingly, Harris reported that her Rapid DNA Service Team within the Bureau of Forensic Services cleared California's entire DNA backlog for the first time in history, having developed a process that allowed higher volume analysis of 5,400 evidence samples – an increase of 11% from 2010 (4,800) and 24% from 2009 (4,100).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2012/01/california-dna-evidence-attorney-general.html|title=California attorney general says DNA backlog is gone|newspaper= [[LA Times]]|date=January 25, 2012}}</ref> In April 2014, Harris' team was honored with the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]'s Award for Professional Innovation in Victim Services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/04/08/attorney-general-kamala-harris-honored-for-rape-kit-processing/|title=Attorney General Kamala Harris Honored For Rape Kit Processing|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[CBS Sacramento]]|date=April 8, 2014}}</ref> Harris' office would later be awarded a $1.6 million grant from the [[Manhattan District Attorney]]'s initiative to eliminate the backlogs of untested [[rape kits]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.turlockjournal.com/news/crime/grant-awarded-to-test-rape-kits/|title=Grant awarded to test rape kits

In 2014, Harris introduced two new data-based tools for law enforcement.  The first was OpenJustice, a first-in-the-nation criminal justice data initiative designed with professor professor [[Steven Raphael]] making available statewide data on arrest rates, deaths in law enforcement custody, arrest-related deaths, and law enforcement deaths. The tool consisted of two components: a Dashboard that spotlights key criminal justice indicators with user-friendly visualization tools and an Open Data Portal that publishes raw data from the California Department of Justice's statewide repository of criminal justice datasets. Subsequent improvements to the platform revealed data pertaining to clearance rates and racial disparities in the criminal justice system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/17/california-dojs-openjustice-platform-makes-local-law-enforcement-data-more-transparent/|title=California's DOJ OpenJustice Platform Makes Local Law Enforcement Data More Transparent|work=[[TechCrunch]]|date=February 17, 2016}}</ref>Later that year, Harris announced the creation of SmartJustice, an app-based web portal consolidating all databases in California to allow police officers to efficiently search a suspect's formal criminal record on a secure mobile platform while in the field. SmartJustice has been adopted by more than 40 California law enforcement agencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtech.com/public-safety/Californias-SmartJustice-Mimics-Google-Search-for-Cops.html|title=California's SmartJustice Mimics Google Search for Cops

On May 1, 2019, Barr testified before the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] one day after it was reported that [[Special Counsel]] [[Robert Mueller]] told Barr his 4-page summary of the [[Mueller Report]] failed to "fully capture the findings." <ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/mueller-complained-that-barrs-letter-did-not-capture-context-of-trump-probe/2019/04/30/d3c8fdb6-6b7b-11e9-a66d-a82d3f3d96d5_story.html |title=Mueller complained that Barr’s letter did not capture ‘context’ of Trump probe |date=April 30, 2019 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=May 16, 2020}}</ref> During the hearing, Barr remained defiant about the misrepresentations in the four-page summary he released ahead of the full report.<ref>{{cite news |title=Barr defiant amid furor over his handling of Mueller report|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/30/politics/bill-barr-hearing-congress-senate/index.html |first=Laura |last=Jarrett|publisher=[[CNN]] |date=May 2, 2019}}</ref> First, Harris asked whether Barr had reviewed the underlying evidence before deciding not to charge the President with obstruction of justice, to which Barr admitted that neither he, [[Rod Rosenstein]], nor anyone in his office reviewed the evidence supporting the report before making the charging decision.<ref>{{cite news |title=KAMALA HARRIS GUTS BARR LIKE A FISH, LEAVES HIM FLOPPING ON THE DECK|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/05/kamala-harris-william-barr |first=Bess |last=Levin|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=May 1, 2019}}</ref> Harris then asked:

That December, Harris led a group of Democratic Senators in demanding the removal of White House senior adviser [[Stephen Miller (political advisor)|Stephen Miller]] after emails published by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] revealed coordination with far-right website [[Breitbart]] to shape stories related to race and immigration and encouraging writers to draw on material from [[white supremacy]] sources, such as the racist 1973 French novel [[The Camp of the Saints]].

Ahead of the [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump]] on January 16, 2020, Harris delivered remarks on the floor of the Senate, stating her views on the integrity of the American justice system and the principle that nobody is above the law:

{{quote|"We now face a choice: will we insist that we have one system of justice that applies equally to all? Or will we continue to have two systems of justice, in which some are above the law?

In February, Harris pressed Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Senate Homeland Security Committee]], Senator [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]] for a public hearing about the [[coronavirus]] with public health officials, pointing out that administration officials were unwilling to attend the hearing about protecting the country from the possibility of a pandemic.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-harris-demands-coronavirus-hearing-with-trump-administration-officials|title=VIDEO: Harris Demands Coronavirus Hearing With Trump Administration Officials| publisher=Senator Kamala Harris| accessdate=February 12, 2020| date=May 8, 2020}}</ref> In March 2020, Harris questioned DHS official [[Ken Cuccinelli]] about preparations taken to safeguard vulnerable populations against the coronavirus.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://krcrtv.com/north-coast-news/eureka-local-news/sen-kamala-harris-questions-dept-of-homeland-security-officials-on-how-theyre-protectin|title=Kamala Harris questions DHS officials on protecting vulnerable populations from COVID-19| publisher=ABC7 KRCR News| accessdate=May 15, 2020| date=March 5, 2020}}</ref>
