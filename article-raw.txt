== Early career ==
{{Main|Electoral history of Kamala Harris}}
Harris served as a deputy [[district attorney]] in [[Alameda County, California]], from 1990 to 1998.

In April 2004, [[San Francisco Police Department]] Officer Isaac Espinoza was shot and killed in the line of duty. Three days later, Harris announced she would not seek the [[death penalty]], infuriating the [[San Francisco Police Officers Association]]. During Officer Espinoza's funeral at [[Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption (San Francisco, California)|St. Mary's Cathedral]], U.S. Senator and former San Francisco mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] rose to the pulpit and called on Harris, who was sitting in the front pew, to secure the death penalty, prompting a standing ovation from the 2,000 uniformed police officers in attendance. Harris still refused. Officer Espinoza's killer was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.<ref name=NYTmag/> Shortly thereafter, Harris demoted veteran career prosecutor Paul Cummins, the chief assistant to her predecessor from the 80-person felony prosecution unit to Harris's former position in the DA's office.<ref>{{cite news|last1=van Debenkern|first1=Jackson|title=DA Demotes Head Criminal Prosecutor: 33-year veteran assigned to  job overseeing 2 people|url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-D-A-demotes-head-criminal-2642229.php|work=San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref>

In 2004, as District Attorney, Harris started the Back On Track initiative, a reentry program.<ref name=NYTmag/> Initiative participants (who are nonviolent, first-time drug offenders whose crimes were not weapon- or gang-related) plead guilty in exchange for a deferral of sentencing and regular appearances before a judge over a year-long period.

====Housing====
When Harris took office in 2011, California was still reeling from the effects of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. In 2012, she participated in the National Mortgage Settlement against five banks, securing $12 billion of debt reduction for the state's homeowners and $26 billion overall.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Kamala-Harris-foreclosure-deal-a-win-for-state-3381270.php | title=Kamala Harris' foreclosure deal a win for state | date=March 5, 2012 | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | author1=Parker, Barbara | author2=Rebecca Kaplan | accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/12/business/la-fi-0512-harris-housing-20120512 |title=Mortgage deal cash is divvied | date=May 12, 2012 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Lazo, Alejandro |accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref>

She introduced the California Homeowner's Bill of Rights in the [[California State Legislature]], a set of laws which took effect on January 1, 2013, banning the practices of "dual-tracking" (processing a modification and foreclosure at the same time) and [[robo-signing]], and provided homeowners with a single point of contact at their lending institution. It also gave the California Attorney General more power to investigate and prosecute financial fraud and to convene special [[grand jury|grand juries]] to prosecute multi-county crimes instead of prosecuting a single crime county by county.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-passage-bills-california-homeowner | title=Attorney General Kamala D.

==== Prison conditions and sentencing reform ====
After the United States Supreme Court in ''[[Brown v. Plata]]'' (2011) declared California's prisons so overcrowded they inflicted [[cruel and unusual punishment]], Harris fought federal court supervision, explaining "I have a client, and I don't get to choose my client."<ref name="NYTmag" /> After California failed to fully implement the court's order to reduce crowding, and was ordered to implement new parole programs, the State of California appealed the decision, and in court filings the AG's office argued that if forced to release these inmates early, prisons would lose an important source of labor,<ref name="latimes_20141114">{{cite news|last1=St. John|first1=Paige|title=Federal judges order California to expand prison releases|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-ff-federal-judges-order-state-to-release-more-prisoners-20141114-story.html|access-date=October 12, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> such as for [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection|fighting wildfires]].<ref name="Neklason">Annika Neklason, [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/how-much-longer-will-inmates-fight-californias-wildfires/547628/ California Is Running Out of Inmates to Fight Its Fires], ''The Atlantic'' (December 7, 2017).</ref> Prisoners in California earn between 8 and 37 cents per hour in maintenance and kitchen jobs;<ref name="latimes_20141114"/> prisoner firefighters receive higher pay, at $1 per hour.<ref name="Neklason"/> Harris later backed away from her office's argument in the prison-litigation case, telling the website ''[[ThinkProgress]]'': "The way that argument played out in court does not reflect my priorities...

Harris refused to take any position on criminal sentencing-reform initiatives [[California Proposition 36, 2012|Proposition 36 (2012)]] and [[California Proposition 47 (2014)|Proposition 47 (2014)]], arguing it would be improper because her office prepares the ballot booklets.<ref name="NYTmag" /> Former California Attorney General [[John Van de Kamp]] considered her explanation "baloney."<ref name="NYTmag" />

==== County prosecutors' misconduct ====
In 2015, Harris defended convictions obtained by county prosecutors who had inserted a false confession into an interrogation transcript, committed perjury, and withheld evidence.<ref name="NYTmag" /> Federal appeals court Judge [[Alex Kozinski]] threw out the convictions, telling Harris's lawyers, "Talk to the attorney general and make sure she understands the gravity of the situation."<ref name="NYTmag" />

Harris appealed the dismissal of an indictment when it was discovered a [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] prosecutor perjured in submitting a falsified confession as court evidence. Harris asserted that prosecutorial perjury was not sufficient to demonstrate prosecutorial misconduct.

== Political positions ==

===Abortion===
Since her election to the Senate, Harris has maintained a 100% rating by the abortion rights [[advocacy group]] called [[Planned Parenthood Action Fund]] and a 0% rating by the anti-abortion group [[National Right to Life Committee]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/120012/kamala-harris#.W0uuKdJKiUm|title=Kamala Harris's Ratings and Endorsements|last=|first=|date=July 15, 2018|website=VoteSmart.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>

=== Cannabis ===
In May 2018, Harris announced she would co-sponsor the Marijuana Justice Act, which [[Cory Booker|Sen. Cory Booker]] introduced in August 2017. The legislation would eliminate [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]'s status as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] drug under the [[Controlled Substance Act]]. The move would also require federal courts to expunge the records of Americans who have prior marijuana convictions related to use or possession. She believes the move to decriminalize marijuana will prevent the [[Justice Department]] from enforcing laws that are “unjust and unfair.”<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/regulation/legislation/387101-kamala-harris-backs-booker-bill-to-legalize-marijuana |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=May 10, 2018 |title=Kamala Harris backs Booker bill to legalize marijuana |accessdate=August 9, 2018 |first=Aris |last=Folley}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://twitter.com/SenKamalaHarris/status/994595315805310976 |work=[[NowThis News|NowThis]] |date=May 10, 2018 |title=Sen.

===Death penalty===
Harris is opposed to the [[death penalty]], but has said that she would review each case individually.<ref name="sfbg.com">{{cite news |title=Give Kamala Harris credit for integrity |author=Tim Redmond |url=http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2009/09/11/give-kamala-harris-credit-integrity |newspaper=[[The San Francisco Bay Guardian]] |date=November 9, 2009 |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref> Her position was questioned in April 2004, when [[San Francisco Police Department|SFPD]] Officer Isaac Espinoza was murdered in the Bayview district. Harris announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing. The decision evoked protests from the [[San Francisco Police Officers Association]], Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]], and others.<ref name=NYTmag/> Those who supported her decision not to seek the death penalty included San Francisco Supervisors [[Tom Ammiano]] and [[Sophie Maxwell]], in whose district the murder occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basetree.com/photos/sets/photography39.html |title=Don't Kill in Our Name, Rally to Support Kamala Harris |website=Basetree |date=May 5, 2004 |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> The jury found the convicted killer, David Hill, guilty of [[second-degree murder]], although the prosecutor, Harry Dorfman, had sought a [[first-degree murder]] conviction.<ref name="SF Sentinel">{{cite web|url=http://www.sanfranciscosentinel.com/?p=1353 |title=Police Officer Isaac Espinoza killer gets two consecutive life sentences—No possibility of parole |publisher=Sanfranciscosentinel.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> The defense had argued that Hill thought Espinoza was a member of a rival gang, and that the murder was not premeditated. Hill was given the maximum sentence for the conviction, [[life without the possibility of parole]].<ref name="SF Sentinel" />

Harris's position against the death penalty was tested again in the case of [[Edwin Ramos]], an [[undocumented immigrant]] and alleged [[MS-13]] gang member who was accused of murdering Tony Bologna and his sons Michael and Matthew.<ref name="FinneganProgram">Finnegan, Michael.

When in 2014, U.S. District Judge [[Cormac J. Carney]] declared [[capital punishment in California]] unconstitutional, Harris reviewed the case.<ref name=NYTmag/>

=== Disaster relief ===
In August 2018, Harris was one of eight senators to sign a letter to the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] charging the agency with not assisting displaced homeowners in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Maria]] under the Individuals and Households (IHP) program at "alarming rates."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/400182-dems-push-fema-on-housing-help-for-displaced-puerto-ricans|title=Dems push FEMA on housing help for displaced Puerto Ricans|first=Maya|last=Lora|date=August 2, 2018|publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

===Education===
In interviews with [[Matt Lauer]] on ''[[The Today Show]]'' and local [[KGO-TV]], Harris argued for treating "habitual and chronic [[truancy]]" among children in elementary school as a crime committed by the parents of truant children. She argues that there is a direct connection between habitual truancy in elementary school and crime later in life.<ref>{{cite web|author=&ldquo;&rdquo; |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i0tpAqrDDY |title=KGO/ABC 7's View from the Bay's Interview with Kamala Harris on Truancy Rates |publisher=YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=&ldquo;&rdquo; |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-c-4FlgUT0 |title=Kamala Harris on the Today Show |publisher=YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> She has received the endorsement of the California Federation of Teachers.<ref name="Endorsements" />
=== Election security ===
On December 21, 2017, Harris was one of six senators to introduce the Secure Elections Act, legislation authorizing block grants for states that would update outdated voting technology as well as form a program for an independent panel of experts that would work toward the development of cybersecurity guidelines for election systems which would then be implemented by states if they choose along with offering states resources to install the recommendations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/365986-bipartisan-group-of-lawmakers-introduces-new-election-security-bill|title=Bipartisan group of lawmakers backs new election security bill|date=December 21, 2017|publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

===Environment===
During her time as San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created the Environmental Justice Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Jason B.|title=SAN FRANCISCO / D.A. creates environmental unit / 3-staff team takes on crime mostly affecting the poor|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-06-01/bay-area/17376837_1_environmental-justice-bird-droppings-san-francisco-city-hall|accessdate=August 20, 2010|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=June 1, 2005}}</ref> and prosecuted several industries and individuals for pollution, most notably [[U-Haul]], Alameda Publishing Corporation, and the [[Cosco Busan oil spill]]. She also advocated for strong enforcement of environmental protection laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kamalaharris.org/issues/Environment|accessdate=October 3, 2011|title=Protecting the Environment}}</ref>

In September 2018, Harris was one of eight senators to sponsor the Climate Risk Disclosure Act, a bill described by cosponsor [[Elizabeth Warren]] as using "market forces to speed up the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy — reducing the odds of an environmental and financial disaster without spending a dime of taxpayer money."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/406700-warren-wants-companies-to-disclose-more-about-climate-change|title=Warren wants companies to disclose more about climate change impacts|date=September 14, 2018|publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

=== Foreign policy ===
In April 2017, responding to the [[Khan Shaykhun chemical attack]], Harris charged [[president of Syria|Syrian president]] [[Bashar al-Assad]] with attacking Syrian children, and stated "the clear fact that president Assad is not only a ruthless dictator brutalizing his own people -- he is a war criminal the international community cannot ignore." She called on president Trump to work with Congress on his administration's "lack of clear objectives in Syria and articulate a detailed strategy and path forward in partnership with our allies."<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-harris-statement-on-us-military-action-in-syria|title=Senator Harris Statement on U.S. Military Action in Syria|date=April 6, 2017|publisher=Office of Senator Kamala Harris}}</ref>

In February 2018, Harris was one of 18 Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump stating that he lacked the authority to launch a preemptive strike against [[North Korea]] without authorization from Congress. The letter stated: "Without congressional authority, a preventative or preemptive U.S. military strike would lack either a constitutional basis or legal authority."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/372311-dem-senators-tell-trump-he-doesnt-have-legal-authority-to-launch-preemptive|title=Dem senators tell Trump he doesn’t have ‘legal authority’ to launch preemptive strike on North Korea|date=February 5, 2018|publisher=The Hill|first=Brett|last=Samuels}}</ref>

In 2018, after Trump announced the United States was withdrawing from the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]], Harris released a statement saying the decision "jeopardizes our national security and isolates us from our closest allies" while calling the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action "the best existing tool we have to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and avoid a disastrous military conflict in the Middle East."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-statement-on-trump-violating-the-iran-nuclear-deal|title=Harris Statement on Trump Violating the Iran Nuclear Deal|date=May 8, 2018|publisher=Kamala Harris United States Senator for California}}</ref>

In December 2018, after [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Mike Pompeo]] announced the Trump administration was suspending its obligations in the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] in 60 days in the event that Russia continued to violate the treaty, Harris was one of 26 senators to sign a letter expressing concern over the administration "now abandoning generations of bipartisan U.S. leadership around the paired goals of reducing the global role and number of nuclear weapons and ensuring strategic stability with America's nuclear-armed adversaries" and calling on Trump to continue arms negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/defense/421307-senate-dems-urge-trump-to-continue-nuclear-arms-control-negotiations-after|title=Senate Dems urge Trump to continue nuclear arms control negotiations after treaty suspension|date=December 13, 2018|first=Ellen|last=Mitchell|publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

While serving as district attorney in San Francisco, Harris, along with other district attorneys, filed an [[amicus brief]] in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'', arguing that the Washington, D.C., gun law at issue did not violate the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/07-290_amicus_district_attorneys.pdf|title=''D.C. v.

In response to the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]], Harris supported the call for more gun control. Saying that she believed that [[thoughts and prayers]] are inadequate answers to the shooting, she stated that "...we must also commit ourselves to action.

In December 2018, Harris was one of forty-two senators to sign a letter to Trump administration officials [[Alex Azar]], [[Seema Verma]], and [[Steve Mnuchin]] arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to "increase health care costs for millions of consumers while weakening protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions." The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and "re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://urbanmilwaukee.com/pressrelease/u-s-senator-tammy-baldwin-calls-on-trump-administration-to-stop-pushing-health-insurance-plans-that-weaken-pre-existing-condition-protections/|title=U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin Calls on Trump Administration to Stop Pushing Health Insurance Plans that Weaken Pre-Existing Condition Protections|date=December 20, 2018|publisher=urbanmilwaukee.com}}</ref>

In a January 2018 interview, when asked by Hiram Soto about her ideal version of a bipartisan deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Harris stated the need to focus on comprehensive immigration reform and "pass a clean [[DREAM Act]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/hoy-san-diego/noticias/san-diego/sdhoy-sen-kamala-harris-talks-daca-future-run-for-president-20180112-story.html|title=Senator Kamala Harris talks DACA amid heated negotiations |date=January 12, 2018|first=Hiram|last=Soto|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune}}</ref>

That's being a leader on public safety. What is not, is ripping babies from their mothers."<ref name=":7" />

In August 2018, Harris led fifteen Democrats and [[Bernie Sanders]] in a letter to [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security]] [[Kirstjen Nielsen]] demanding that the Trump administration take immediate action in attempting to reunite 539 migrant children with their families, citing each passing day of inaction as intensifying "trauma that this administration has needlessly caused for children and their families seeking humanitarian protection."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/401999-senate-democrats-demand-immediate-reunification-of-remaining-separated|title=Senate Dems demand immediate reunification of remaining separated children|first=Nathaniel|last=Weixel|date=August 15, 2018|publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

=== LGBT Rights ===

As a member of the US Senate, she co-sponsored the Equality Act. <ref name=":10">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/10/25/kamala-harris-rises-as-lgbt-favorite-for-2020-theres-just-one-thing/|title=Kamala Harris rises as LGBT favorite for 2020 — there's just one thing|date=2017-10-25|website=Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref>

In 2015, while the Attorney General of California, Harris argued in court to withhold gender reassignment surgery from two transgender inmates who were prescribed the procedure while serving the sentences.
