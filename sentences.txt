On August 23, 2020, Jacob S. Blake, a 29-year-old American black man, was shot from behind seven times by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin United States.
Protests occurred in response, as part of the larger Black Lives Matter movement which had seen a resurgence in the wake of high-profile police killings in 2020, including those of George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks, and Breonna Taylor.
Witnesses said that Blake had been attempting to break up a fight between two women.
Police were responding to a call about a domestic dispute, and subsequently attempted to subdue Blake with a taser.
A bystander who heard police yelling "drop the knife" recorded a video which showed Blake surrounded by police with their weapons drawn.
Blake was reportedly unarmed.
He walked around his vehicle and attempted to enter it.
As he did, one police officer grabbed him and fired his weapon into Blake's back.
Blake's attorney later said that Blake's three sons were inside the vehicle at the time, and that Blake had been going to check on them.
Blake was left in serious condition and flown to Froedtert Hospital.
Protests followed, leading the Kenosha County government to declare a state of emergency overnight on August 24 after police vehicles were damaged, a dump truck was set on fire, and the local courthouse was vandalized.
One officer was knocked unconscious and transported to a hospital after being hit in the head with a brick, and tear gas was deployed.
Police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of what it alleged were "numerous" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired.
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued a statement denouncing the excessive use of force by police and invoking the names of African Americans killed by law enforcement.
Evers said,
While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country.
Evers called Wisconsin state lawmakers into a special session to pass legislation addressing police brutality.
Subsequently, he deployed the Wisconsin National Guard to maintain public safety after the shooting.
Up to 200 members will be deployed.
Presidential candidate Joe Biden said, "these shots pierce the soul of our nation".
The family of Jacob Blake has retained attorney Benjamin Crump, the same civil attorney who represented the families of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown in their civil suits.
