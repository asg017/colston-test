Kamala D. Harris (born 1964 in Oakland, California) is the current District Attorney of San Francisco.
She is the first female African-American and the first Indian-American district attorney in the state's history.
She was elected in December 2003 with over 56 percent of the votes, in a run-off election against the two-term incumbent, Terence Hallinan.
Harris is the daughter of a prominent Indian-American breast cancer specialist who emigrated to the United States in 1960, and an African-American professor of economics at Stanford University.
Kamala attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., and received a law degree from Hastings College of the Law in 1990.
She served as Deputy District Attorney in Alameda County from 1990 to 1998.
She then became the Managing Attorney of the Career Criminal Unit of the San Francisco District Attorney's office before Louise Renne recruited her to join the City Attorney's office in August 2000, where she was Chief of the Community and Neighborhood Division.
In 1998, Harris was named by the Daily Journal as one of the top 20 young lawyers in California.
She serves on the boards of several community organizations.
She is also a founder of the Coalition to End the Exploitation of Kids (CEEK), which aspires to end San Francisco’s epidemic of child prostitution.
CEEK plans to open a safe house for exploited children, start a 24-hour crisis hotline and raise funds for important social services.
Harris led an aggressive campaign against Hallinan in 2003, accusing him of being soft on crime, noting that during his tenure, the city's crime rate went up while conviction rates went down.
Because of her multi-cultural background, Harris was considered as a candidate at ease with different groups.
She was endorsed by Senator Diane Feinstein, and the police establishment and lawyers' forums, and she raised more than twice the campaign funds as Hallinan.
Despite her many accomplishments, Harris' tenure as District Attorney has not been without controversy.
She was romantically involved with Willie Brown in 1994 when he was Speaker of the State Assembly.
At the time, she was 30 and he 60.
Their affair was the talk of the town before Brown's successful 1995 bid to become mayor.
But shortly after he was inaugurated, the relationship ended, and Harris denied allegations that she was indebted to Brown in any way.
In April 2004, when police officer Isaac Espinoza was gunned down in the crime-riddled Bayview district, Harris announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing, a decision that triggered a torrent of protests from police officers and much politicizing at Officer Espinoza's funeral.
In October 2005, Harris was featured on an episode of Oprah Winfrey’s program entitled "Eight Women Oprah Wants You to Know," an episode which also featured Police Chief Heather Fong.
