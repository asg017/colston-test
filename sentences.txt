Marjorie Taylor Greene (born May 27, 1974) is an American politician and businesswoman from the state of Georgia.
She is the Republican nominee for in the 2020 elections.
Greene was born in Milledgeville, Georgia, on May 27, 1974.
She graduated from South Forsyth High School in Cumming, Georgia, and the University of Georgia with a bachelor's degree in business administration.
Greene began her 2020 candidacy in Georgia's 14th after incumbent Tom Graves announced he would not run for reelection.
Greene finished in first place in the primary election and faced John Cowan in the runoff election.
Greene defeated Cowan to win the nomination on August 11.
Greene is considered an overwhelming favorite to win the seat in the general election, as the 14th typically votes heavily Republican.
The 14th has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+27, making it the 10th most Republican district in the nation and the third most Republican district in the Eastern Time Zone.
Among Georgia's congressional districts, only the neighboring 9th district is more Republican.
Donald Trump carried the 14th with 75 percent of the vote in 2016, his eighth-best performance in the nation.
On the day after Greene's runoff victory, Trump tweeted his support for her, describing Greene as a "future Republican Star" who "is strong on everything and never gives up â€” a real WINNER!"
If she wins election, she will be the second Republican woman to represent Georgia in the House.
The first, Karen Handel, was elected to represent the 6th in a special election in 2017, but was defeated for a full term in 2018.
However, Greene would be the first Republican woman elected to a full term from a Georgia district.
Greene was initially expected to face Democratic IT specialist Kevin Van Audsal.
However, on September 11, 2020; Van Audsal withdrew from the race.
This left Greene unopposed for the general election, though the district is so heavily Republican that Van Audsal faced very long odds even if he had remained in the race.
Since the 14th's creation in 2012, no Democrat has won even 30 percent of the vote.
Greene and her husband, Perry, have owned Taylor Commercial, a construction company based in Alpharetta, Georgia, since 2002.
She has long lived in Alpharetta, which is in the 6th District.
While members of the House are only required to live in the state they represent, Greene stated soon after considering a run for the 14th that she intended to move to that district if she ran there.
