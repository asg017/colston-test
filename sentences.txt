Kamala Devi Harris (born October 20, 1964) is an American attorney and politician serving as the junior United States Senator for California since 2017.
A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served as the 32nd Attorney General of California from 2011 to 2017, and as District Attorney of San Francisco from 2004 to 2010.
On January 21, 2019, Harris officially announced her campaign to run for President of the United States in the 2020 United States presidential election.
Born in Oakland, California, Harris is a graduate of Howard University and University of California, Hastings College of the Law.
In the 1990s, Harris worked in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office and the City Attorney of San Francisco's office.
In 2004, Harris was elected District Attorney of San Francisco.
Harris was narrowly elected as California's Attorney General in 2010 and reelected in 2014 by a wide margin.
On November 8, 2016, she defeated Loretta Sanchez in the 2016 Senate election to succeed outgoing Senator Barbara Boxer, becoming California's third female U.S. Senator.
Harris has supported Medicare for all, legalization of recreational marijuana, sanctuary cities, passing a DREAM Act, and lowering taxes for the working and middle classes while raising taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans.
Kamala Harris was born on October 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, to a Tamil Indian mother and a Jamaican father.
Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, was a breast cancer scientist who immigrated to the United States from Madras (now Chennai) in 1960.
Her father, Donald Harris, is a Stanford University economics professor who emigrated from Jamaica in 1961 for graduate study in economics at University of California, Berkeley.
Her name, Kamala, comes from the Sanskrit word for the lotus flower.
Her family lived in Berkeley, California, where both of her parents attended graduate school.
She was close to her maternal grandfather, P. V. Gopalan, an Indian diplomat.
As a child, she frequently visited her extended family in the Besant Nagar neighborhood of Chennai, Tamil Nadu.
Harris grew up going to both a black Baptist church and a Hindu temple.
She has one younger sister, Maya Harris.
They both sang in a Baptist choir.
Harris's parents divorced when she was seven, and her mother was granted custody of the children by court-ordered settlement.
After the divorce, her mother moved with the children to Montreal, Québec, Canada, where Shyamala accepted a position doing research at Jewish General Hospital and teaching at McGill University.
After graduating from Montreal's Westmount High School in Québec, Harris attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., where she majored in political science and economics.
At Howard, Harris was elected to the liberal arts student council as freshman class representative, was a member of the debate team, and joined the Alpha Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.
Harris returned to California, where she earned her Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, in 1989.
She was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1990.
Harris served as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California, from 1990 to 1998.
Harris says she sought a career in law enforcement because she wanted to be "at the table where decisions are made".
In 1993, she started dating California Speaker of the Assembly Willie Brown, who introduced her to many powerful individuals in the California and Sacramento political and campaign management establishment.
In 2000, San Francisco's elected City Attorney, Louise Renne, recruited Harris to join her office, where she was chief of the Community and Neighborhood Division, which oversees civil code enforcement matters.
Harris defeated two-term incumbent Terence Hallinan in the 2003 election to become District Attorney of the City and County of San Francisco.
In April 2004, San Francisco Police Department Officer Isaac Espinoza was shot and killed in the line of duty.
Three days later, Harris announced she would not seek the death penalty, infuriating the San Francisco Police Officers Association.
During Officer Espinoza's funeral at St. Mary's Cathedral, U.S. Senator and former San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein rose to the pulpit and called on Harris, who was sitting in the front pew, to secure the death penalty, prompting a standing ovation from the 2,000 uniformed police officers in attendance.
Harris still refused.
Officer Espinoza's killer was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.
Shortly thereafter, Harris demoted veteran career prosecutor Paul Cummins, the chief assistant to her predecessor from the 80-person felony prosecution unit to Harris's former position in the DA's office.
In 2004, as District Attorney, Harris started the Back On Track initiative, a reentry program.
Initiative participants (who are nonviolent, first-time drug offenders whose crimes were not weapon- or gang-related) plead guilty in exchange for a deferral of sentencing and regular appearances before a judge over a year-long period.
Participants who succeed in obtaining a high-school-equivalency diploma, maintaining steady employment, taking parenting classes, and passing drug tests have their records cleared.
Over eight years, the program produced fewer than 300 graduates, but achieved a very low recidivism rate.
In 2009, a state law (the Back on Track Reentry Act, Assembly Bill 750) was enacted, encouraging other countries to start programs around a similar model.
Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the bill into law.
The program encountered some controversy because it initially included illegal immigrants, including one, Alexander Izaguirre, who was later arrested for assault.
Harris said allowing persons not eligible to work in the United States was a mistake, and subsequently modified the program to bar anyone who could not legally be employed in the United States.
Harris was re-elected in 2007 when she ran unopposed.
In 2008, Harris was seen as one of a number of women who could become president of the United States.
In 2009, Harris's book Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor's Plan to Make Us Safer was published by Chronicle Books.
In the book, Harris touted her Back On Track initiative and argued for what she referred to as "a smarter approach when it comes to combating nonviolent crime" emphasizing crime prevention, truancy prevention, and the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder in children.
The book discusses a series of "myths" surrounding the criminal justice system and presents proposals to reduce and prevent crime.
Recognized by The Los Angeles Daily Journal as one of the top 100 lawyers in California, Harris served on the board of the California District Attorney's Association and was vice president of the National District Attorneys Association.
In 2013, a report by the San Francisco Weekly reported that the San Francisco Police Department and Harris's office shielded Abraham H. Guerra Sr., a high-ranking member of the Norteño gang, from returning to prison due to parole violations because Guerra was an informant who provided authorities with information.
While Harris was the San Francisco District Attorney, the overall felony conviction rate rose from 52% in 2003 to 67% in 2006, the highest in a decade; there was an 85% conviction rate for homicides, and convictions of drug dealers increased from 56% in 2003 to 74% in 2006.
While these statistics represent only trial convictions, Harris also closed many cases via plea bargains.
When she took office, she took a special interest in clearing part of the murder caseload from the previous administration.
Harris stated that the records from that administration were less than optimal, and worked to get convictions on what she could.
Out of the 73 homicide cases backlogged, 32 cases took deals for lesser charges such as manslaughter or took pleas to other crimes such as assault or burglary while the murder charges were dismissed.
Officers within the SFPD credited Harris with tightening loopholes in bail and drug programs that defendants had exploited in the past.
They also accused her of being too deliberate in her prosecution of murder suspects.
Additionally, in 2009, San Francisco prosecutors won a lower percentage of their felony jury trials than their counterparts at district attorneys' offices covering the 10 largest cities in California, according to data on case outcomes compiled by officials at the San Francisco Superior Court as well as by other county courts and prosecutors.
(Officials in Sacramento, the sixth-largest city in California, did not provide data.) Harris's at-trial felony conviction rate that year was 76%, down 12 points from the previous year.
The then-most recent recorded statewide average was 83%, according to statistics from the California Judicial Council.
In a small sample, a report computed that the conviction rate for felony trials in San Francisco County in the first three months of 2010 was 53%.
San Francisco has historically had one of the lowest conviction rates in the state; the county is known for a defendant-friendly jury pool.
In 2012, Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo ruled that San Francisco District Attorney Harris's office violated defendants' rights by hiding damaging information about a police crime lab technician, and was indifferent to demands that it account for its failings.
As San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created a special Hate Crimes Unit, focusing on hate crimes against LGBT children and teens in schools.
She convened a national conference to confront the "gay-transgender panic defense", which has been used to justify violent hate crimes.
Harris supports same-sex marriage in California and opposed both Proposition 22 and Proposition 8.
In 2004, The National Urban League honored Harris as a "Woman of Power".
In 2005, she received the Thurgood Marshall Award from the National Black Prosecutors Association.
In her campaign for California Attorney General, she received the endorsements of numerous groups including EMILY's List, California Legislative Black Caucus, Asian American Action Fund, Black Women Organized for Political Action, the National Women's Political Caucus, Mexican American Bar Association, and South Asians for Opportunity.
On November 12, 2008, Harris announced her candidacy for California Attorney General.
Both of California's United States Senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, endorsed Harris during the Democratic Party primary.
In the June 8, 2010, primary, she was nominated with 33.6% of the vote, defeating Alberto Torrico (who received had 15.6% of the vote) and Chris Kelly (who received 15.5%).
In her campaign for California Attorney General, Harris received the endorsements of United Farm Workers cofounder Dolores Huerta, United Educators of San Francisco, and San Francisco Firefighters Local 798.
She also received the endorsement of Antonio Villaraigosa, Mayor of Los Angeles.
In the general election, she faced Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley.
On election night, November 2, 2010, Cooley prematurely declared victory, but many ballots remained uncounted.
On November 24, as the count advanced, Harris was leading by more than 55,000 votes, and Cooley conceded.
On January 3, 2011, Harris became the first female, Jamaican-American, and Indian-American attorney general in California.
Harris announced her intention to run for re-election in February 2014 and filed paperwork to run on February 12.
According to the office of California Secretary of State Debra Bowen, Harris had raised the money for her campaign during the previous year in 2013.
The Sacramento Bee, Los Angeles Daily News, and The Los Angeles Times endorsed Harris for reelection.
On November 4, 2014, Harris was re-elected against Republican Ronald Gold.
When Harris took office, California was still reeling from the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis.
In 2012, she participated in the National Mortgage Settlement against five banks, securing $12 billion of debt reduction for the state's homeowners and $26 billion overall.
She introduced the California Homeowner's Bill of Rights in the California State Legislature, a set of laws which took effect on January 1, 2013, banning the practices of "dual-tracking" (processing a modification and foreclosure at the same time) and robo-signing, and provided homeowners with a single point of contact at their lending institution.
It also gave the California Attorney General more power to investigate and prosecute financial fraud and to convene special grand juries to prosecute multi-county crimes instead of prosecuting a single crime county-by-county.
After the United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Plata (2011) declared California's prisons so overcrowded they inflicted cruel and unusual punishment, Harris fought federal court supervision, explaining "I have a client, and I don't get to choose my client."
After California failed to fully implement the court's order to reduce crowding, and was ordered to implement new parole programs, the State of California appealed the decision, and in court filings the AG's office argued that if forced to release these inmates early, prisons would lose an important source of labor, such as for fighting wildfires.
Prisoners in California earn between 8 and 37 cents per hour in maintenance and kitchen jobs; prisoner firefighters receive higher pay, at $1 per hour.
Harris later backed away from her office's argument in the prison-litigation case, telling the website ThinkProgress: "The way that argument played out in court does not reflect my priorities...The idea that we incarcerate people to have indentured servants is one of the worst possible perceptions. I feel very strongly about that. It evokes images of chain gangs."
Harris refused to take any position on criminal sentencing-reform initiatives Proposition 36 (2012) and Proposition 47 (2014), arguing it would be improper because her office prepares the ballot booklets.
Former California Attorney General John Van de Kamp considered her explanation "baloney."
In February 2014, Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, a transgender woman incarcerated at California's Mule Creek State Prison, filed a federal lawsuit based on the state's failure to provide her with what she argued was medically necessary sex reassignment surgery (SRS).
In April 2015, a federal judge ordered the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to provide Norsworthy with SRS, finding that prison officials had been "deliberately indifferent to her serious medical need."
Harris, representing CDCR, challenged the order in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Harris argued that "Norsworthy has been receiving hormone therapy for her gender dysphoria since 2000, and continues to receive hormone therapy and other forms of treatment" and that "there is no evidence that Norsworthy is in serious, immediate physical or emotional danger."
In August 2015, while the state's appeal was pending, Norsworthy was released on parole, obviating the state's duty to provide her with inmate medical care.
and rendering the case moot.
Harris maintained that the parole review process was independent of Norsworthy's legal case against CDCR, although the Ninth Circuit, in its opinion, said it was possible that Norsworthy's release on parole, ahead of her scheduled SRS, may have been influenced by CDCR officials.
Harris has prosecuted numerous financial crimes, such as predatory lending.
Since her election to the Senate, Harris has maintained a 100% rating by the abortion rights group Planned Parenthood Action Fund and a 0% rating by the anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee.
In May 2018, Harris announced she would co-sponsor the Marijuana Justice Act, which Sen. Cory Booker introduced in August 2017.
The legislation would eliminate marijuana's status as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substance Act.
The move would also require federal courts to expunge the records of Americans who have prior marijuana convictions related to use or possession.
She believes the move to decriminalize marijuana will prevent the Justice Department from enforcing laws that are “unjust and unfair.”
Harris is opposed to the death penalty, but has said that she would review each case individually.
Her position was tested in April 2004, when SFPD Officer Isaac Espinoza was murdered in the Bayview district.
Harris announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing.
The decision evoked protests from the San Francisco Police Officers Association, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and others.
Those who supported her decision not to seek the death penalty included San Francisco Supervisors Tom Ammiano and Sophie Maxwell, in whose district the murder occurred.
The jury found the convicted killer, David Hill, guilty of second-degree murder, although the prosecutor, Harry Dorfman, had sought a first-degree murder conviction.
The defense had argued that Hill thought Espinoza was a member of a rival gang, and that the murder was not premeditated.
Hill was given the maximum sentence for the conviction, life without the possibility of parole.
Harris's position against the death penalty was tested again in the case of Edwin Ramos, an undocumented immigrant and alleged MS-13 gang member who was accused of murdering Tony Bologna and his sons Michael and Matthew.
On September 10, 2009, Harris announced she would seek life in prison without the possibility of parole rather than the death penalty in the Ramos case.
Harris has expressed the belief that life without possibility of parole is a better, and more cost-effective, punishment.
According to the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, the death penalty costs $137 million per year.
If the system were changed to life without possibility of parole, the annual costs would be approximately $12 million per year.
Harris noted that the resulting surplus could put 1,000 more police officers into service in San Francisco alone.
When in 2014, U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney declared capital punishment in California unconstitutional, Harris reviewed the case.
In August 2018, Harris was one of eight senators to sign a letter to the Federal Emergency Management Agency charging the agency with not assisting displaced homeowners in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria under the Individuals and Households (IHP) program at "alarming rates."
In interviews with Matt Lauer on The Today Show and local KGO-TV, Harris argued for treating "habitual and chronic truancy" among children in elementary school as a crime committed by the parents of truant children.
She argues that there is a direct connection between habitual truancy in elementary school and crime later in life.
She has received the endorsement of the California Federation of Teachers.
On December 21, 2017, Harris was one of six senators to introduce the Secure Elections Act, legislation authorizing block grants for states that would update outdated voting technology as well as form a program for an independent panel of experts that would work toward the development of cybersecurity guidelines for election systems which would then be implemented by states if they choose along with offering states resources to install the recommendations.
During her time as San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created the Environmental Justice Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office and prosecuted several industries and individuals for pollution, most notably U-Haul, Alameda Publishing Corporation, and the Cosco Busan oil spill.
She also advocated for strong enforcement of environmental protection laws.
In September 2018, Harris was one of eight senators to sponsor the Climate Risk Disclosure Act, a bill described by cosponsor Elizabeth Warren as using "market forces to speed up the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy — reducing the odds of an environmental and financial disaster without spending a dime of taxpayer money."
In April 2017, responding to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Harris charged Syrian president Bashar al-Assad with attacking Syrian children, and stated "the clear fact that president Assad is not only a ruthless dictator brutalizing his own people -- he is a war criminal the international community cannot ignore."
She called on president Trump to work with Congress on his administration's "lack of clear objectives in Syria and articulate a detailed strategy and path forward in partnership with our allies."
In February 2018, Harris was one of 18 Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump stating that he lacked the authority to launch a preemptive strike against North Korea without authorization from Congress.
The letter stated: "Without congressional authority, a preventative or preemptive U.S. military strike would lack either a constitutional basis or legal authority."
In 2018, after Trump announced the United States was withdrawing from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Harris released a statement saying the decision "jeopardizes our national security and isolates us from our closest allies" while calling the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action "the best existing tool we have to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and avoid a disastrous military conflict in the Middle East."
In December 2018, after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the Trump administration was suspending its obligations in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 60 days in the event that Russia continued to violate the treaty, Harris was one of 26 senators to sign a letter expressing concern over the administration "now abandoning generations of bipartisan U.S. leadership around the paired goals of reducing the global role and number of nuclear weapons and ensuring strategic stability with America's nuclear-armed adversaries" and calling on Trump to continue arms negotiations.
Harris earned an "F" rating from the National Rifle Association for her consistent efforts supporting gun control.
While serving as district attorney in San Francisco, Harris, along with other district attorneys, filed an amicus brief in District of Columbia v. Heller, arguing that the Washington, D.C., gun law at issue did not violate the Second Amendment.
In her second term as district attorney, she said that getting guns off the streets was a priority.
During her run for Senate, she was endorsed by former U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords, shot in Tucson in 2011.
She was also endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.
In response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Harris supported the call for more gun control.
Believing that thoughts and prayers are inadequate answers to the shooting, she stated that "...we must also commit ourselves to action. Another moment of silence won't suffice."
On August 30, 2017, Harris announced at a town hall in Oakland that she would co-sponsor fellow Senator Bernie Sanders' "Medicare for All" bill, supporting single-payer healthcare.
In April 2018, Harris was one of ten senators to sponsor the Choose Medicare Act, an expanded public option for health insurance that also increased ObamaCare subsidies and rendered individuals with higher income levels eligible for its assistance.
In December 2018, Harris was one of forty-two senators to sign a letter to Trump administration officials Alex Azar, Seema Verma, and Steve Mnuchin arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to "increase health care costs for millions of consumers while weakening protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions."
The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and "re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress."
Harris has expressed support for San Francisco's sanctuary city policy of not inquiring about immigration status in the process of a criminal investigation.
Harris argues that it is important that immigrants be able to talk with law enforcement without fear.
On October 25, 2017, Harris stated she would not support a spending bill until Congress addressed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in a way that clarified "what we are going to do to protect and take care of our DACA young people in this country."
She did not support a February 2018 proposal by some Democrats to provide President Trump with $25 billion in funding for a border wall in exchange for giving DREAMers a pathway to citizenship.
In a January 2018 interview, when asked by Hiram Soto about her ideal version of a bipartisan deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Harris stated the need to focus on comprehensive immigration reform and "pass a clean DREAM Act."
In July 2018, the Trump administration falsely accused Harris of "supporting the animals of MS-13."
Harris responded, "As a career prosecutor, I actually went after gangs and transnational criminal organizations. That's being a leader on public safety. What is not, is ripping babies from their mothers."
In August 2018, Harris led fifteen Democrats and Bernie Sanders in a letter to United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen demanding that the Trump administration take immediate action in attempting to reunite 539 migrant children with their families, citing each passing day of inaction as intensifying "trauma that this administration has needlessly caused for children and their families seeking humanitarian protection."
In November 2018, Harris was one of eleven senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Defense James Mattis concerning "the overt politicization of the military" with the Trump administration's deployment of 5,800 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and requesting a briefing and written justification from the U.S. Northern Command for troop deployment while urging Mattis to "curb the unprecedented escalation of DOD involvement in immigration enforcement."
Harris opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and has called for a repeal of the bill's tax cuts for wealthy Americans.
In 2018, she proposed a tax cut for the majority of working- and middle-class Americans.
An analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that the bill would reduce federal revenue by $2.8 trillion over a decade.
Harris proposed to pay for the tax cuts by repealing tax cuts for wealthy Americans and by increasing taxes on corporations.
Harris has disavowed most corporate donations, and has committed to rejecting money from corporate political action committees for her presidential campaign.
Harris is married to California attorney Douglas Emhoff, who was at one time partner-in-charge at Venable LLP's Los Angeles office.
They married on August 22, 2014, in Santa Barbara, California.
Harris's sister is Maya Harris, MSNBC political analyst, and her brother-in-law is Tony West, General Counsel of Uber and a former U.S. Justice Department senior official.
Harris has no children, but through her marriage has two stepchildren, one in college and one in high school.
Before marrying Emhoff, Harris dated San Francisco mayor Willie Brown.
