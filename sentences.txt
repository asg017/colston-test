Kamala D. Harris (born 1964 in Oakland, California) is the current District Attorney of San Francisco.
She is the first woman to be elected as District Attorney in San Francisco and the first female African-American to serve as top prosecutor in the state's history.
She was elected in December 2003 with over 56 percent of the votes, in a run-off election against the two-term incumbent, Terence Hallinan.
Harris is the daughter of a prominent Indian-American breast cancer specialist who emigrated to the United States in 1960, and an African-American professor of economics at Stanford University.
Harris attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., and received a law degree from Hastings College of the Law in 1990.
A veteran prosecutor, Harris served as Deputy District Attorney in Alameda County from 1990 to 1998.
She then became the Managing Attorney of the Career Criminal Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office.
In 2000, City Attorney Louise Renne recruited her to join the City Attorney's office in August 2000, where she was Chief of the Community and Neighborhood Division.
In 1998, Harris was named by the Daily Journal as one of the top 20 young lawyers in California.
She serves on the boards of several community organizations.
She is also a founder of the Coalition to End the Exploitation of Kids (CEEK), which aspires to end San Francisco’s epidemic of child prostitution.
CEEK plans to open a safe house for exploited children, start a 24-hour crisis hotline and raise funds for important social services.
Harris led an aggressive campaign against Hallinan in 2003.
Because of her multi-cultural background and grassroots community work, Harris was considered as a candidate at ease with different groups.
She was endorsed by the San Francisco Chronicle, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Police Officers Association and lawyers' forums.
In October 2005, Harris was featured on an episode of Oprah Winfrey’s program entitled "Eight Women Oprah Wants You to Know," an episode which also featured Police Chief Heather Fong and Fire Chief Joanne Hayes White.
Harris was also featured in Newsweek Magazine as one of the "top 20 women leaders" in America.
