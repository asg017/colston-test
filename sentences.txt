Kamala Devi Harris (born October 21, 1964, in Oakland, California).
She was elected in 2007 when she ran, unopposed, for District Attorney.
She was also cited by the New York Times to be among the seventeen most likely women to become the first female President of the United States.
Harris attended the historically African American college, Howard University in Washington, D.C. and received a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from University of California, Hastings College of the Law in 1989.
She is the daughter of an Tamil Indian mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer specialist, who immigrated to the United States from Chennai, India in 1960, and a Jamaican American father, Stanford University economics professor Donald Harris.
Harris served as Deputy District Attorney in Alameda County, California from 1990 to 1998.
She then became Managing Attorney of the Career Criminal Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office.
In 2000, San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne recruited her to join the her office, where she was Chief of the Community and Neighborhood Division, which oversees civil code enforcement matters.
In 2004, The National Urban League honored Harris as a "Woman of Power" and she received the Thurgood Marshall Award from the National Black Prosecutors Association in 2005.
The Los Angeles Daily Journal recognized Harris as one of the top 100 lawyers in California.
Additionally, she has served on the boards of several community organizations.
In April 2004, when police officer Isaac Espinoza was gunned down in the Bayview district, Harris announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing, a decision which triggered protests from the police officers union, Sen. Diane Feinstein, and many citizens.
Some were supportive of the decision in a community where capital punishment is opposed.
Harris had made a campaign promise that she would not seek the death penalty if elected.
Attorney General Bill Lockyer even threatened to intervene on behalf of the State of California to take the case out of Harris' jurisdiction.
In the end, he ruled that Harris had acted within her legal authority.
This stand is again being tested in the case of Edwin Ramos, an alleged MS13 gang-member who allegedly murdered a family in a case of mistaken gang retaliation.
Ms. Harris, whom critics often label as "soft on crime," has also come under fire for a drug-diversion program ("Back on Track") which accepted illegal alien felons for job-training when such persons could not legally hold jobs in the United States.
This came to light when one program client, Alexander Izaguirre, allegedly grabbed a woman's purse then attempted to run her over in the process of his getaway.
Harris has also been criticized about the DA's role in the much publicized case of the Bologna family that was gunned down by an alleged gang member who had been arrested just a month earlier with a gun that had been used in a murder, but the DA's office had declined to press charges.
Harris ran unopposed for re-election in 2007.
She has received acclaim from some for increasing conviction rates over previous DA, Terence Hallinan (whose conviction rate was 52% versus the 83% state-wide average), but has been widely criticized for selectively prosecuting cases to bolster the conviction rate, which now stands at about 67%.
However, San Francisco still has the lowest incarceration rate in the state of California.
Harris has also faced criticism in the face of continuing poor relations with police and rising violent crime rates.
Harris is a lousy candidate for Attorney General of California in 2010.
