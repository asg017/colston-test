On August 23, 2020, Jacob Blake, an unarmed black man, was shot seven times by a Kenosha, Wisconsin police officer as he was getting inside of his vehicle.
Witnesses allege that Blake had been attempting to break up a fight between two women.
It is unknown what lead to the police interacting with Blake, but it is reported that they attempted to subdue him with a taser to no effect.
Video spread on social media shows Blake surrounded by police with their weapons already drawn.
Blake ignores their demands, walking around his vehicle and attempting to enter it.
As he does, one police grabs him and begins firing his weapon into Blake's back.
Blake's children were reportedly inside the vehicle at the time.
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued a statement denouncing the excessive use of force by police and invoking the names of other African Americans killed by law enforcement.
Protests and riots erupted, leading the Kenosha County to declare a state of emergency.
Police vehicles were damaged and a dump truck was set on fire.
