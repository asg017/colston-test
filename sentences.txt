Jacob S. Blake is a 29-year-old African-American man who was hit by four of seven shots fired at his back during an arrest by police officer Rusten Sheskey.
The incident occurred in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 23, 2020, as officers were attempting to arrest Blake over a domestic violence dispute.
During the encounter, Blake was tasered and scuffled with officers.
He was shot as he opened the driver’s door to his SUV and leaned into the vehicle, where a knife was subsequently found.
Three of Blake's sons were in the backseat.
The shooting was followed by protests, property damage, and arson in downtown Kenosha, and further clashes with police.
Blake's name was invoked in protests in other cities as part of the Black Lives Matter movement, which had seen a resurgence in the wake of high-profile police killings in 2020.
Kenosha police responded to a 9-1-1 report where "a complainant said Blake wasn't supposed to be there, and that he had taken the complainant's keys and refused to give them back".
According to a witness, Blake pulled his car up near "six or seven women shouting at each other on the sidewalk" and "Blake did not say anything to the women".
Blake's attorney, Benjamin Crump, said Blake "was attempting to de-escalate a fight between two other people when officers arrived at the scene", and that Blake tried to enter his vehicle to check on his three sons inside.
Officers attempted to subdue Blake, and used a taser on him.
A bystander who recorded a video of the incident heard police yelling "drop the knife", and also said, "I didn't see any weapons in his hands, he wasn't being violent".
After an initial scuffle, Blake walked to the driver's side of his vehicle followed by Sheskey and another officer with guns drawn.
Sheskey attempted to grab Blake, and when Blake opened the driver's side door and leaned in, Sheskey grabbed him and fired seven shots towards Blake's back.
Crump said Blake was hit by four of the seven bullets.
In a press conference on August 26, 2020, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said that a knife was recovered on the driver's side floor of Blake's vehicle, and Blake admitted to investigators that he had a knife.
Blake was flown to Froedtert Hospital in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.
His father announced on August 25 that Blake was paralyzed from the waist down and that doctors do not know yet if the injury will be permanent.
Kenosha police referred the investigation of the shooting to the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation.
As part of the process, findings from the investigation will go to District Attorney Michael D. Graveley, the local official responsible for deciding to bring charges against the officers.
Graveley stated on August 25 that the investigation was in "its earliest stages".
On August 25, the United States Department of Justice also announced an investigation into the shooting.
The investigation will look into whether Blake's civil rights were violated.
Blake's family retained Crump, who also represented the families of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown in their civil suits.
Crump has called for the officer who opened fire to be arrested and others involved to lose their jobs, and also said that it would "take a miracle" for Blake to walk again.
On August 26, Wisconsin's attorney general Josh Kaul announced that Kenosha police officer Rusten Sheskey had shot Blake seven times in the back as he opened the door of his car.
No other officers at the scene fired, but all have now been placed on administrative leave.
Protests followed, leading the Kenosha County government to declare a state of emergency overnight on August 24 after police vehicles were damaged, a dump truck was set on fire, and the local courthouse was vandalized.
A video posted by a local newspaper appeared to show an officer being knocked down with a brick, and tear gas was deployed.
Police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of what it alleged were "numerous" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired.
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers deployed the Wisconsin National Guard to maintain public safety after the shooting.
Up to 200 members were planned to be deployed.
On August 24, the protestors set fires and looted businesses for a second night.
On August 25, 2020 the protests and fires continued throughout Kenosha.
Citizens armed with long guns occupied parts of the city.
On August 25, a 17-year-old white male shot three protestors, killing two.
The alleged shooter, Kyle Rittenhouse, was later arrested in Antioch, Illinois on charges of first-degree intentional homicide.
He was labeled a “fugitive from justice” in the complaint, which states he “fled the state of Wisconsin with intent to avoid prosecution for that offense.” He has been assigned a public defender and was scheduled to appear at an extradition hearing on August 28.
Under Wisconsin state law, he will be charged as an adult.
He has been described as a "police admirer," and publicly expressed support for law enforcement and Blue Lives Matter.
Police announced that the two people who were shot and killed were a 26-year-old Silver Lake resident and a 36-year-old Kenosha resident.
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued a statement denouncing the excessive use of force by police and invoking the names of African Americans killed by law enforcement.
Evers said, "While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country."
Evers called Wisconsin state lawmakers into a special session to pass legislation addressing police brutality.
Former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said "these shots pierce the soul of our nation".
