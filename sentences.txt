Edward Colston (2 November 1636 &ndash; 11 October 1721) was a Bristol-born English merchant and philanthropist.
Much of his wealth, although used often for generous purposes, was acquired through the trade and exploitation of slaves.
He was born 2 november 1636 in Temple Street, Bristol, the eldest of at least eleven children.
His parents were William Colston, a prosperous merchant and Sarah (née Batten).
He was brought up in Bristol until the time of the English Civil War, when he probably lived for a while on his father's estate in Winterbourne, south Gloucestershire.
The family then moved to London where Edward may have been a pupil at Christ's Hospital.
He was apprenticed to the Mercers Company for eight years and by 1672 was shipping goods from London.
He built up a lucrative business, trading with Spain, Portugal, Italy and Africa.
In 1680, Colston became a member of the Royal African Company, which had held the monopoly in Britain on gold, ivory and slave trading since 1662.
His parents had resettled in Bristol and in 1682 he made a loan to the Corporation, the following year becoming a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers and a burgess of the City.
In 1684 he inherited his brother's mercantile business in Small Street, and was a partner in a sugar refinery in St. Peter's Churchyard; shipping sugar from St. Kitts.
But he was never resident in Bristol, carrying on his London business from Mortlake in Surrey until he retired in 1708.
He founded almshouses in King Street and on St. Michaels Hill, endowed Queen Elizabeth's Hospital school and helped found Colston's School, which opened in 1710 leaving an endowment to be managed by the Society of Merchant Venturers for its upkeep.
He gave money to schools in Temple and other parts of Bristol, and to several churches and the cathedral.
He was a strong Tory and high-churchman, and was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bristol in 1710 for just one parliament.
He died 11 October 1721 at his home in Mortlake.
His body was carried back to Bristol and was buried at All Saints Church.
His tomb was designed by James Gibbs.
A statue, designed by John Cassidy, was erected in the centre of Bristol in 1895 commemorating Colston.
He was widely viewed as an inspirational figure for the city, due to his donations of money to schools and other causes.
His name permeates the city in such landmarks as Colston Tower, Colston Hall, Colston Hill, Colston Street, Colston Parade, Colston's Girls' School and Colston's School.
He is also remembered, particularly in schools, by Colston's Day, on 13 November.
Colston is a controversial figure these days in Bristol.
In the 1990s, public knowledge of his participation in the slave trade grew.
Bristol band Massive Attack refused to play at Colston Hall, and his statue has been repeatedly defaced and vandalised most recently with trickles of deep red paint being poured at his feet.

==Programme notes
Influenced predominantly by two historical Bulgarian dances, the Širto and Dajcovo, Digressions fuses two diverse cultures and styles of music: traditional Eastern dances and contemporary western genres.
Taking a deeper look, we can see that these two elements are in fact a composite of further sub-fusions.
The brilliant timbral quality of the brass instruments is employed to encapsulate a traditional western fanfare with woodwind added as colour, giving both the intrada and appearing at the end of piece to dictate its ternary structure.
Moreover, despite being written in common time for ease of performance, it uses the 3+2+2 beat of the Širto as the underlying rhythmic motif, starting based on an F7 chord in the xylophone and progressively spreading throughout the piece, with the harmonic textures layered above it, giving a traditional western style an Eastern European twist.
Punctuated by a brief drum cadenza, the Širto meter drives on though this time it is fused with contemporary western jazz to create a hugely rhythmic, atonal yet distinctively jazzy dance, a motif which is constantly featured and developed throughout the piece.
This jazz passage progressively builds and breaks through to introduce the third and final theme: simple serialism (making use of material solely based on the untransposed prime order P0) is superimposed above the newly introduced 2+2+2+3 Dajcovo rhythm.
Following the preliminary presentation of all three motifs, we enter a development section where the second contemporary “jazzy” theme is subsequently merged with conventional blues chords and styles, such as the distinctive and commonly used seventh chords and the hi-hat drum kit instrumentation.
However, to add harmonic variety seconds, thirds and fourths are often inserted or layered above chords, all of which are juxtaposed against the double bass pizzicato of a transposed original atonal theme, giving a first hint of bitonality.
Following the Širto rhythm of the previous theme, the Dajcovo meter subsequently takes over and introduces a late tonal theme in the clarinet, though in a reversal of roles it is the rhythm the theme emphasises that carries the greatest importance as it is the rhythm that is immediately developed and reused instead of the harmony.
During this development, this rhythmic motif splits into two variations, one becoming more rhythmically stable played in the bass (with an on-beat second quaver) and the second the opposite left in the treble (dividing the already unstable last beat further into two sets of three semiquavers and made even more volatile by the juxtaposed 2+2+2+3 and 3+3+3 bar subdivisions).
Moreover, a quasi-soundtrack style harmony overlays the beat and carries the development forward, with the climatic build-up controlled by a precise cannon that gradually filters through most of the instruments.
After dying down with a rhythmic repetition of the primary motif in the chalemeau register of the clarinet, all that remains is the almost march-like stable variant rhythm of the previous section in the bass leading us into the next part of the development.
Having just been reminded by the clarinet, we once again hear the primary motif in fragments first on the xylophone, spreading through the instruments as the fragments are developed and juxtaposed against the continued rhythm of the previous theme to create a small fast-burn build-up that slips the harmony back into atonality.
This leads to a separate development of themes 2, 3 and 4 with an augmented shortened serialist theme 3 layered above a transposed “jazzy” theme 2 in the double bass all whilst the key rhythmic pattern of theme 4 is emphasised by the bongos for later.
The latter half of this passage plays around with both the rhythm and harmonic material of theme 2, first filtering out its rhythmic feature for use as an accompaniment ostinato, then using its chromatic elements as the harmony (using the first 3 chromatic notes of the theme), building up towards a developed restatement of theme 4 in the double bass and trombone whilst the theme 2 is moved into the background.
However, this is cut short by a booming bass echo of the developing theme 2 and as it returns to the foreground, we see the entire ensemble playing with its irregular rhythm and dissonant chromatic harmony.
In succession of a brief interlude based upon the rhythmic impressions of theme 2, layered over by a quick restatement of theme 3, we enter a completely new fusion of western contemporary and dance styles giving rise to an avante-garde club dance.
makes use of the traditional and raw nature of the folk culture embedded and entwined within the regional music and blends it with contemporary western musical styles.
These dances were chosen not only for their lively features and long roots tied deep in the area but also for their very unusual and fascinatingly irregular meters (2+2+3 and 2+2+2+3), differing from traditional British dances.
This is certainly epitomised within the music with these two off-beat rhythms intertwined with each other, acting as the underlying architecture carrying through the digressing and layered harmonies, often echoing the folk melodies of the region, hence giving the name.
