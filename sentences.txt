He founded Colston's School in 1710 to provide education for poor boys, leaving an endownment to be managed by the Society of Merchant Venturers for its upkeep.
In 1680 Colston became a member of the Royal African Company, which had held the monopoly on gold, ivory and slave trading between Britain and Africa.
A statue was erected in Bristol in 1895 commemorating Colston.
He was widely viewed as an inspirational figure for the city, due to his donations of vast sums of money to schools and other causes.
His name permeates the city in such landmarks as the Colston Tower, Colston Hall, Colston Hill and Colston's school.
He is also remembered, particularly in schools, by Colston's Day, on the 13th November.
Colston is a controversial figure these days in Bristol.
