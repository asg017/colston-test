On August 23, 2020, Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old black man, was shot from behind seven times by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Protests occurred in response, as part of the larger Black Lives Matter movement which had seen a resurgence in the wake of high-profile police killings in 2020, including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.
Witnesses alleged that Blake had been attempting to break up a fight between two women.
It is unknown what led to the police interacting with Blake, but it has been reported that they attempted to subdue him with a taser.
Video on social media showed Blake surrounded by police with their weapons drawn.
Blake ignored their demands, walked around his vehicle and attempted to enter it.
As he did, one police officer grabbed him and fired his weapon into Blake's back.
The Kenosha News reported "it was not immediately known whether the man had a weapon".
Blake's attorney later said that Blake's three sons were inside the vehicle at the time.
Blake was left in serious condition and flown to a hospital.
Protests followed, leading the Kenosha County government to declare a state of emergency overnight on August 24 after police vehicles were damaged, a dump truck was set on fire, looting occurred, and the local courthouse was vandalized.
One officer was hit in the head with a flying object, and tear gas was deployed.
Police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of what it alleged were "numerous" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired.
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued a statement denouncing the excessive use of force by police and invoking the names of African Americans killed by law enforcement.
Evers stated that,
While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country.
