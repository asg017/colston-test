On August 23, 2020, Jacob Blake, an unarmed black man, was shot seven times by a Kenosha, Wisconsin police officer as he was getting inside of his vehicle.
Witnesses allege that Blake had been attempting to break up a fight between two women.
It is unknown what lead to the police interacting with Blake, but it is reported that they attempted to subdue him with a taser to no effect.
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued a statement denouncing the excessive use of force by police and invoking the names of other African Americans killed by law enforcement.
Protests and riots erupted, leading the Kenosha County to declare a state of emergency.
Police vehicles were damaged and a dump truck was set on fire.
