Edward Colston (1636 &ndash; 1721) was a Bristol-born English merchant, although he lived the moved to London in 1654 where he lived until his death, though he still provided much financial support for causes in Bristol such as education, healthcare and the church.
Today, though, he is a controversial figure in the city as a prominent part of the slave trade.
He was a member of the Royal African Company, which held the sole government grant for slave trading in the late 1600s.
Colston was a prominent trader in sugar, shipping large quantities from the island of St. Kitts to his refinery in Bristol.
Colston's contributions to the city of Bristol are unquestionable.
He funded many schools and school improvements, and provided money for social and health programs and charities.
He also restored a number of churches.
In 1680 Colston became a member of the Royal African Company, which had held the monopoly on gold, ivory and slave trading between Britain and Africa.
A statue was erected in Bristol in 1895 commemorating Colston.
He was widely viewed as an inspirational figure for the city, due to his donations of vast sums of money to schools and other causes.
His name permeates the city in such landmarks as the Colston Tower, Colston Hall, Colston Hill and in school names as well.
Colston is a controversial figure these days in Bristol.
In the 1990s, knowledge of his participation in the slave trade grew.
Bristol band Massive Attack refused to play at Colston Hall, and his statue has been repeatedly defaced and vandalised.
