On August 23, 2020, Jacob S. Blake, a 29-year-old man ignored Kenosha, Wisconsin police orders and was shot after he opened the door to his SUV and leaned into the vehicle as police were attempting to stop him.
Police were attempting to arrest Blake during a domestic dispute, during which Blake was stun-gunned and scuffled with officers.
He was shot as he leaned into his SUV while both of his feet were outside of the vehicle after he opened the door to his SUV and leaned in when police were trying to stop him.
He had his children in the backseat of that SUV.
The shooting was followed by protests, rioting, property damage, fires in downtown Kenosha, and further clashes with riot police.
Blake's name was invoked in protests in other cities as part of the larger Black Lives Matter movement, which had seen a resurgence in the wake of high-profile police killings in 2020.
Police responded to a 9-1-1 call in which the dispatcher "reported that a complainant said Blake wasn't supposed to be there, and that he had taken the complainant's keys and refused to give them back".
According to a witness, Blake had pulled his car up near "six or seven women shouting at each other on the sidewalk" and "Blake did not say anything to the women".
Blake's attorney, Benjamin Crump, said Blake "was attempting to de-escalate a fight between two other people when officers arrived at the scene", and that Blake tried to enter his vehicle to check on his three sons inside.
Officers attempted to subdue Blake, and tased him.
A bystander who recorded a video of the incident heard police yelling "drop the knife", and also said, "I didn't see any weapons in his hands, he wasn't being violent".
Other reports said Blake was unarmed.
After an initial scuffle, Blake got away and walked to the driver side of his vehicle followed by two officers with guns drawn.
The closest officer tried to grab Blake, and when Blake opened the door and leaned in, that officer grabbed him and fired at least seven shots into Blake's back.
Crump said Blake was hit by four of the seven bullets.
Blake was flown to Froedtert Hospital.
His father announced on August 25 that Blake was paralyzed from the waist down and that doctors do not know if the injury will be permanent.
Kenosha police referred the investigation of the shooting to the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation.
As part of the process, findings from the investigation will go to District Attorney Michael D. Graveley, the local official responsible for deciding to bring charges against the officers.
Graveley stated on August 25 that the investigation was in "its earliest stages".
Blake's family retained Crump, who also represented the families of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown in their civil suits.
Crump has called for the officer who opened fire to be arrested and others involved to lose their jobs, and also said that it would "take a miracle" for Blake to walk again.
On August 25, the United States Department of Justice announced an investigation into the shooting.
The investigation will look into whether Blake's civil rights were violated.
Protests followed, leading the Kenosha County government to declare a state of emergency overnight on August 24 after police vehicles were damaged, a dump truck was set on fire, and the local courthouse was vandalized.
One officer was knocked unconscious and transported to a hospital after being hit in the head with a brick, and tear gas was deployed.
Police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of what it alleged were "numerous" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired.
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers deployed the Wisconsin National Guard to maintain public safety after the shooting.
Up to 200 members were planned to be deployed.
On August 24, the rioters and protestors set fires and looted businesses for a second night.
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued a statement denouncing the excessive use of force by police and invoking the names of African Americans killed by law enforcement.
Evers said, "While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country."
Evers called Wisconsin state lawmakers into a special session to pass legislation addressing police brutality.
Former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said, "these shots pierce the soul of our nation".
In the NBA bubble, the Milwaukee Bucks boycotted their August 26 first-round playoff game against the Orlando Magic in protest of the shooting.
The team decided not to come out of their locker room as the Magic were on the court warming up minutes before the scheduled start to the game.
The Toronto Raptors have also discussed a boycott of their second round playoff series with the Boston Celtics in frustration with a lack of social or legislative change after George Floyd's death and as a result of Blake's shooting.
Later that day, the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association announced that in light of the Milwaukee Bucksâ€™ decision to refuse to play, all NBA games for the day were postponed.
On August 24, in New York City 700 protesters marched from Times Square to Brooklyn to condemn the shooting and calls for defunding the police.
Metal barriers were erected to prevent protesters from crossing the Brooklyn Bridge, however 300 protesters jumped them.
