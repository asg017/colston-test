On August 23, 2020, Jacob S. Blake, a 29-year-old American black man, while resisting arrest was shot from behind by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States.
Police were attempting to arrest Blake, who, according to the Blake family attorney Benjamin Crump, had intervened in a domestic dispute; in the process, Blake was tased and scuffled briefly with officers.
He was shot as he tried to enter his SUV, where his children were in the backseat.
The shooting was followed by protests, property damage, fires in downtown Kenosha, and further clashes with riot police.
Commentators drew links between the Blake shooting, the reaction, and the larger Black Lives Matter movement, which had seen a resurgence in the wake of high-profile police killings in 2020, including those of George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks, and Breonna Taylor.
Police responded to a 911 call in which the dispatcher "reported that a complainant said Blake wasn't supposed to be there, and that he had taken the complainant's keys and refused to give them back".
According to witness Raysean White, Blake had pulled his car up near "six or seven women shouting at each other on the sidewalk" and "Blake did not say anything to the women".
At some point during the police interaction with Blake, officers attempted to subdue Blake with a taser.
Blake was reportedly unarmed.
After the initial scuffle with police, Blake got away from them and walked around his vehicle and opened the driver-side door.
A bystander who heard police yelling "drop the knife" recorded a video which showed Blake surrounded by police with their weapons drawn.
As Blake walked to the driver side of the vehicle, he was followed by two officers who had guns drawn, and the closest officer tried to grab him.
Nevertheless, Blake successfully reached the driver-side door and opened it.
As he leaned into the vehicle, one police officer grabbed him and fired his weapon at least seven times towards Blake's back.
Blake's attorney, Benjamin Crump, said Blake "was attempting to de-escalate a fight between two other people when officers arrived at the scene", and that Blake tried to enter his vehicle to check on his three sons inside.
Blake was flown to Froedtert Hospital.
His father announced on August 25 that Blake was paralyzed from the waist down and that doctors do not know if the injury will be permanent.
At the time of the incident, Blake had a felony arrest warrant out for sexual assault.
The State Justice Department will investigate the shooting, with the findings going to District Attorney Michael D. Graveley.
His office will determine whether or not to bring charges against the officers.
Graveley stated that the investigation was in "its earliest stages".
The family of Jacob Blake has retained attorney Benjamin Crump, who also represented the families of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown in their civil suits.
Protests followed, leading the Kenosha County government to declare a state of emergency overnight on August 24 after police vehicles were damaged, a dump truck was set on fire, and the local courthouse was vandalized.
One officer was knocked unconscious and transported to a hospital after being hit in the head with a brick, and tear gas was deployed.
Police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of what it alleged were "numerous" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired.
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers deployed the Wisconsin National Guard to maintain public safety after the shooting.
Up to 200 members will be deployed.
On August 24 there rioters and protestors set fires and looted business for a second night.
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued a statement denouncing the excessive use of force by police and invoking the names of African Americans killed by law enforcement.
Evers said, "While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country."
Evers called Wisconsin state lawmakers into a special session to pass legislation addressing police brutality.
Presidential candidate Joe Biden said, "these shots pierce the soul of our nation".
