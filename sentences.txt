Kamala Devi Harris (born October 20, 1964) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the junior United States Senator from California since 2017.
A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served as the 27th District attorney of San Francisco from 2004 to 2011 and 32nd Attorney General of California from 2011 until 2017.
Harris was born in Oakland, California, and is a graduate of Howard University and University of California, Hastings College of the Law.
In the 1990s, she worked in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office and the City Attorney of San Francisco's office.
In 2004, she was elected District Attorney of San Francisco.
Harris won the election as California's Attorney General in 2010 by less than 1 point and about 50,000 votes.
She was reelected in 2014 by a wide margin.
On November 8, 2016, she defeated Loretta Sanchez in the 2016 Senate election to succeed outgoing Senator Barbara Boxer, becoming California's third female U.S. Senator, and the first of either Jamaican or Indian ancestry.
Since becoming a senator, she has supported single-payer healthcare, federal descheduling of cannabis, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, the DREAM Act, a ban on assault rifles, and lowering the tax burden for the working and middle classes while raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest one percent of Americans.
She ran as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2020 election, before ending her campaign on December 3, 2019.
Kamala Devi Harris was born on October 20, 1964 in Oakland, California.
Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a Tamil Indian breast-cancer scientist who immigrated to the United States from Madras, India, in 1960 to pursue a doctorate in endocrinology at the University of California, Berkeley.
Her mother was an upper class Brahmin from the Besant Nagar neighborhood of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, whose "Gopalan" bloodline can be traced over 1,000 years.
Shyamala was described as a "feminist concerned that the women who did her laundry were the victims of domestic violence."
Her father, Donald Harris, is a Stanford University economics professor who emigrated from Jamaica in 1961 for graduate study in economics at UC Berkeley.
Harris has one younger sister, Maya Harris.
Her mother chose to give them both Sanskrit names derived from Hindu mythology to help preserve their cultural identity.
She identifies herself as mixed – black and Indian but sees her experience primarily as American.
Harris was raised in Berkeley, California.
She grew up attending both a Black Baptist church, where she and her sister sang in the choir, and a Hindu temple.
As a child, Harris used to visit her extended family in Chennai and was reportedly quite close to her maternal grandfather P.V. Gopalan, who was a career civil servant with federal Government of India.
Harris began kindergarten during the second year of Berkeley's school desegregation busing program, which adopted the extensive use of busing to attempt to bring racial balance to each of the city's public schools; a bus drove her to a school which, two years prior, had been 95% white.
Harris' parents divorced when she was seven, and her mother was granted custody of Harris and her sister.
After the divorce, when she and her sister would visit their father in Palo Alto on the weekends, she stated that neighbors' kids were not allowed to play with them because they were black.
When Harris was 12, she and her sister moved with their mother to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where she had accepted a position doing research at Jewish General Hospital and teaching at McGill University.
She was a popular student at Westmount High School in Westmount, Quebec.
As a teenager, Harris co-founded a small dance troupe of six dancers that played at community centres and fundraisers.
Harris graduated from high school in 1981.
She went on to Howard University in Washington, D.C. where she double-majored in political science and economics, was elected to the liberal-arts student council, was on the debate team, organized mentor programs for local youth, demonstrated against apartheid, and joined Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.
Harris returned to California, where in 1989 she earned her Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco.
She was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1990.
Believing the world needed "more socially aware prosecutors," Harris decided to seek a career in law enforcement because she wanted to be "at the table where decisions are made".
In 1990, Harris was hired as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California where she was noted as being "an able prosecutor on the way up."
She specialized in child sexual abuse trials, which she observed were a difficult type of prosecution, given juries are more inclined to accept the word of an adult over the word of a child.
During this time, Harris also taught advocacy skills at Stanford and University of San Francisco.
Harris dated then-California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown from 1994 to 1995.
Brown began introducing Harris to his political network, resulting in Harris being increasingly featured in local newspapers and society columns.
In 1994, Harris took leave of her position in Alameda County when Brown appointed her to the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board.
Harris served on the board for six months.
Then, during a lame-duck session, Brown appointed her to a three-year term on the California Medical Assistance Commission, overseeing Medi-Cal service contracts.
Regarding these appointments, Harris has said:
""These jobs were created before I was born.
Whether you agree or disagree with the system, I did the work.
I worked hard to keep St. Luke's Hospital open.
I brought a level of life knowledge and common sense to the jobs.
I mean, if you were asked to be on a board that regulated medical care, would you say no?""
Harris ended her relationship with Brown shortly after his mayoral inauguration.
In 2015, she referred to Brown as "a mentor and friend."
In February 1998, San Francisco District Attorney, Terence Hallinan, appointed Harris as an Assistant District Attorney.
She became the chief of the Career Criminal Division, supervising five other attorneys, where she prosecuted homicide, burglary, robbery and sexual assault cases – particularly Three-Strikes cases.
Harris was noted as having been "an excellent mentor" in the office, and had been active in Hallinan's 1999 re-election campaign through his December election.
Harris reportedly clashed with Hallinan's new chief assistant, Darrell Salomon – a former personal attorney to Senator Dianne Feinstein.
Salomon's appointment coincided with the introduction of a state ballot measure – Prop 21 – which would be voted on in an election held in three months.
The proposition would grant prosecutors the option of trying juvenile defendants in Superior Court rather than juvenile courts, authority usually only granted to judges.
Both Harris and Hallinan opposed the measure.
Harris, concerned about the possibility of nearly 40,000 kids per year – mostly minority – being tried in adult court, became very involved in campaigning against the measure, including attending rallies as a speaker, writing position papers and volunteering for the "No-On-21" campaign on weekends.
Her knowledge and commitment to the issue was such that the District Attorney's Public Information Officer at the time, Fred Gardner, would give reporters the option to interview both Harris and Hallinan.
Salomon approached Gardner and instructed him to stop directing Prop 21 media inquiries to Harris.
Gardner inquired if she was planning to run in 2003.
She reportedly replied that it would be "unprofessional" to run against Hallinan if he decided to run for a third term.
Gardner relayed Harris' response to Hallinan.
However, Gardner stated that Hallinan "did not believe her."
Hallinan then ordered that all calls from reporters go directly to him.
He then retaliated and reassigned Harris, which she believed to be a de facto demotion.
Shortly after her reassignment, Harris was a part of a group of supervisors who confronted Hallinan about Salomon's behavior.
However, when their attempt to get him removed failed, Harris then filed a complaint and quit; Saloman folllowed shortly thereafter The spokesman for the District Attorney's office called Harris' defection "a sad day [because Harris was] a good lawyer, well-liked and brilliant."
In August 2000, Harris took a new job at San Francisco City Hall, working for elected City Attorney Louise Renne.
Harris ran the Family and Children's Services Division representing child abuse and neglect cases, domestic violence, building code enforcement, and public health matters.
Together with Dr. Shannon Thyne, who coordinated the Department of Public Health's child sexual abuse program, they created a joint program to spot evidence of child sexual abuse in emergency rooms.
Renne said of Harris:
""She will make the best DA this city has seen in years.""
Harris was reportedly so angry about the discontent in Terence Hallinan's office that she decided to run against him.
She began "methodically gathering support" by attending political events, volunteering on other campaigns, assuming board memberships on nonprofits, being seen at exclusive parties, and presenting herself as an alternative to a "political has-been."
When Harris announced her candidacy, she had served on the board of trustees of the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco, had been a member of San Francisco Jazz Organization, was a patron dinner chair for the San Francisco Symphony's Black & White Ball, was the executive director of the San Francisco Domestic Violence Consortium, led the board of directors of Partners Ending Domestic Abuse, and was a board member of nonprofit, Women Count.
In mid-2002, Harris called Mark Buell, the stepfather of her friend, Summer Tompkins Walker, and told him of her intention to run for District Attorney.
Buell was married to major Democratic megadonor, Susie Tompkins Buell.
Buell, impressed by Harris, offered to be her finance chair.
Buell advised that to beat an incumbent, Harris would need to raise more than $150,000, the highest amount ever raised to campaign for the position.
He and Harris organized a finance committee composed mostly of Harris' friends, who were "young socialite ladies".
The committee included Vanessa Getty and Susan Swig.
Harris sought to run a campaign that disrupted negative stereotypes of black women and set up her campaign office in Bayview – the "most isolated neighborhood" in San Francisco.
– Running against Hallinan, and defense attorney, Bill Fazio, Harris was the least known candidate among the three, but noted to be "whip-smart, hard-working, and well-credentialed."
Rumored to have worked 16 hours per day on her campaign, Harris was lauded for her campaigning skills, particularly for "listen[ing] carefully to the concerns of ordinary people."
Harris' campaign successfully lobbied the 24-member Central Committee – including U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein and then-House Majority leader Nancy Pelosi – of the statewide Democratic party to withhold its influential endorsement from an incumbent.
Hallinan and Fazio sought to link Harris to Willie Brown, who was openly campaigning and fundraising for Harris, through a PAC – California Voter Project – though reportedly without her consent.
Harris denied financially benefitting from Brown.
Harris supporters countered that statements used to tie her to Willie Brown were misogynistic.
Harris' sister, Maya, asked: "When a woman dates an accomplished man, why are people so willing to assume it's only because of him that the woman is successful?"
Harris stumbled when she was found to be guilty, by the city's Ethics Commission, of violating campaign spending limit of $211,000.
Harris had overspent the pledged amount by nearly $100,000.
Harris' supporters said her campaign mistakenly violated the spending cap due to a "misinterpretation of confusing law changes" on the forms.
Harris was fined nearly $35,000 by the Commission and ordered to alert voters, in her mailers, that she had violated the spending limit.
The mailers, subsequently produced by her campaign, were said to have displayed her spending violation with "the smallest font in America."
Harris went on to spend nearly $625,000 throughout the campaign while Hallinan spent just over $285,000.
Hallinan and Harris, who garnered 37% and 33% of the vote, advanced to the general election runoff; Fazio was eliminated from contention.
Hallinan was running for re-election amidst the backdrop of the Fajitagate scandal, in which three off-duty police officers got into a fight with residents over a bag of fajitas, leading to lawsuits and allegations of police misconduct.
Hallinan alleged that Prentice E. Sanders, the city's first black Chief of Police, and other officers were involved in a coverup of the initial criminal acts of the three off-duty officers, indicting all of them for obstruction of justice in February 2003.
Sanders resigned, but Hallinan was forced to drop the charges against Sanders less than a month later when he was unable to prove evidence of a conspiracy.
Sanders pursued legal action to clear his name and was declared factually innocent Hallinan was seen to have damaged his credibility in the wake of the incident.
In the runoff, Harris pledged to never seek the death penalty and only to prosecute three-strike offenders only in cases of violent felonies.
Harris ran on making the sexual abuse of children her top issue.
Harris sought to differentiate her policy positions from those of Hallinan, as it was a "problem" that they ideologically agreed on key issues.
Thus, she focused her attacks on Hallinan's performance.
She charged that, though she worked for Hallinan for two years, she left his office because it was "dysfunctional," technologically inept and was "a mess," emphasizing his "abysmal" 52% conviction rate for serious crimes despite an 83% average conviction rate statewide.
She accused Hallinan of mismanaging his office by promoting people in his office without merit and covering up allegations of prosecutorial misconduct Harris further charged  that his office wasn't doing enough to stem the city's gun violence, particularly in poor neighborhoods like the Bayview and the Tenderloin, and  attacked his willingness to accept plea bargains in cases of domestic violence:
""It is not progressive to be soft on crime." –– Kamala Harris, 2003"
Harris ran a "forceful" campaign, assisted by support from former Mayor Willie Brown, Senator Dianne Feinstein, writer and cartoonist Aaron McGruder, and comedians Eddie Griffin and Chris Rock.
In the closing weeks of the election, Harris secured the endorsements of the longest serving Sheriff in the history of San Francisco, Michael Hennessey, the San Francisco Police Officers Association, and the San Francisco Chronicle.
Hallinan secured the endorsement of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi
Harris won with 56.33% of the vote and became the first woman and the first African-American to lead the District Attorney's Office of San Francisco.
Recognized by The Los Angeles Daily Journal as one of the top 100 lawyers in California, Harris also served on the board of the California District Attorneys Association and was vice president of the National District Attorneys Association.
In 2004, The National Urban League honored Harris as a "Woman of Power."
In 2005, she received the Thurgood Marshall Award from the National Black Prosecutors Association.
Harris was re-elected in 2007 when she ran unopposed.
A 2008 New York Times article listing women who might have the potential to become president of the United States listed then-District Attorney Harris, suggesting she had a reputation as a "tough fighter."
In 2009, Harris's book Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor's Plan to Make Us Safer was published by Chronicle Books.
In the book, she touted her Back On Track initiative and argued for what she referred to as "a smarter approach when it comes to combating nonviolent crime" emphasizing crime prevention, truancy prevention, and the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder in children.
The book discusses a series of "myths" surrounding the criminal justice system and presents proposals to reduce and prevent crime.
In 2004, Harris recruited civil rights activist Lateefah Simon, the youngest woman to ever receive a MacArthur Fellowship, to create San Francisco Reentry Division.
The flagship program was the Back on Track initiative, a first-of-its-kind reentry program for nonviolent, first-time offenders age 18-30.
Initiative participants whose crimes were not weapon or gang-related would plead guilty in exchange for a deferral of sentencing and regular appearances before a judge over a 12 to 18-month period.
The program maintained rigorous graduation requirements, mandating successful completion of up to 220 hours of community service, obtaining a high-school-equivalency diploma, maintaining steady employment, taking parenting classes, and passing drug tests.
At graduation, the court would dismiss the original case and expunge the graduate's record.
Over six years, Harris' pioneer program produced over 200 graduates, and achieved a very low recidivism rate: less than 10 percent, compared to 53 percent of California's drug offenders that returned to prison within two years of release.
Back on Track earned recognition from the U.S. Department of Justice as a model for reentry programs.
The DOJ found that the cost to the taxpayers per participant was markedly lower ($5,000) than the cost of adjudicating a case and housing a low-level offender - $10,000 and $50,000, respectively.
In 2009, a state law (the Back on Track Reentry Act, A.B. 750) was enacted, encouraging other California counties to start similar programs.
Adopted by the National District Attorneys Association as a model program, prosecutor offices in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Atlanta, have used Back on Track as a template for their own programs.
Harris made a campaign pledge to never seek the death penalty.
In April 2004, San Francisco Police Department Officer Isaac Espinoza was shot and killed in the line of duty.
Three days later, Harris announced she would not seek the death penalty, angering the San Francisco Police Officers Association.
During Espinoza's funeral at St. Mary's Cathedral, U.S. Senator and former San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein, in a surprise move, rose to the pulpit and called on Harris, who was sitting in the front pew, to secure the death penalty, prompting a standing ovation from the 2,000 uniformed police officers in attendance.
Immediately thereafter, Association President Gary Delagnes took the pulpit and demanded that Espinoza's killer "pay the ultimate price."
Delagnes received another standing ovation.
Despite immense political pressure from members of California's political establishment, including U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer and Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, Harris still refused.
Public polling found that 70% of city voters overwhelmingly backed Harris' decision not to seek the death penalty, with only 22% opposed.
She also had the support of California Attorney General Bill Lockyer and San Francisco Supervisors Tom Ammiano and Sophie Maxwell, in whose district the murder occurred.
The jury convicted Hill of second-degree murder, although the prosecutor, Harry Dorfman, had sought a first-degree murder conviction.
Harris's position against the death penalty was tested again in the case of Edwin Ramos, an illegal immigrant and alleged MS-13 gang member who was accused of murdering Tony Bologna and his sons Michael and Matthew.
On September 10, 2009, she announced she would seek life in prison without the possibility of parole rather than the death penalty, a decision Mayor Gavin Newsom backed.
Harris has expressed the belief that life without possibility of parole is a better, and more cost-effective, punishment.
According to the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, the death penalty costs $137 million per year.
If the system were changed to life without possibility of parole, the annual costs would be approximately $12 million per year.
She noted that the resulting surplus could put 1,000 more police officers into service in San Francisco alone.
In 2006, as part of an initiative to reduce the city skyrocketing homicide rate, Harris led a city-wide effort with Mayor Gavin Newsom, Police Chief Heather Fong, and various local leaders to combat truancy for at-risk elementary school youth in San Francisco.
Declaring chronic truancy a matter of public safety and pointing out that the vast majority of prison inmates and homicide victims are dropouts or habitual truants, Harris' office met with thousands of parents at high-risk schools and sent out letters warning all families of the legal consequences of truancy at the beginning of the fall semester, adding she would prosecute the parents of chronically truant younger students: penalties included a $2,500 fine and up to a year in jail.
In 2008, Harris issued citations against six parents whose young children missed at least 50 days of school, the first time San Francisco prosecuted adults for student truancy.
San Francisco's school chief, Carlos Garcia, stated that the path from truancy to parental prosecution was lengthy, and that the school district usually spends months encouraging parents to send their children to school through phone calls, reminder letters, private meetings, hearings before the School Attendance Review Board, and offers of help from city agencies and social services; two of the six parents entered no plea but said they would work with the DA's office and social service agencies to create "parental responsibility plans" to help them start sending their children to school regularly.
By the end of April 2009, there were 1,330 elementary school students who were habitual or chronic truants, down from 1,730 in 2008, 2,517 in 2007 and 2,856 in 2006.
This amounted to a staggering 23% drop since the 2005–06 school year.
In so doing, the school districts referred 110 elementary school families to a review board, up from 34 the year before.
Despite the initial controversy surrounding the program for its punitive nature, which would later be raised as a point of criticism in her 2020 presidential campaign, Harris' office only prosecuted seven parents in three years, and not a single parent was ever jailed.
After Harris took over as DA, the overall felony conviction rate rose from 52% in 2003 to 67% in 2006, the highest in a decade.
In 2008, Harris achieved an 88% felony conviction rate, which dipped to 76% in 2009, about 5% below the statewide average.
Convictions of drug dealers increased from 56% in 2003 to 74% in 2006.
While Harris oversaw more than 1900 convictions for marijuana, lawyers working in her office stated that most defendants for low-level marijuana possession were never locked up or even charged with a crime, as consistent with the city and county's low priority for possession crimes.
Only 45 people were sentenced to state prison for marijuana trafficking.
In 2004, Harris created a new unit in the district attorney's office dedicated to prosecuting child assault crimes, staffed by two prosecutors already assigned to the sexual assault detail.
In 2005, a nine year old was violently assaulted after a convicted sex offender broke into a home in the Ingleside district.
Roberto Gamero was arrested on charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child, child molestation, false imprisonment and burglary and later sentenced to more than 17 years in prison.
That summer, Harris' office brought three charges of murder with special circumstances against LaShaun Harris, who was seen throwing her young sons - age 2, 6, and 16 months - into the San Francisco Bay.
LaShaun Harris, a paranoid schizophrenic, pleaded innocent to three counts of murder, stating that "she had carried out God's will."
A jury found her guilty of second-degree murder, but the judge ruled that Harris was insane and ordered her hospitalized for 25 years to life.
The conviction was later upheld on appeal.
In 2008, Harris secured the conviction of and a six year prison sentence for Arvin Mackey for the rape of a 15 year old girl in an apartment in Hunters Point.
Later that year, Harris worked with Assemblyman Mark Leno to draft legislation that provided young bystanders to violent crime up to $5,000 in mental health services.
The legislation, AB2809, allowed child witnesses access funding from the state's Victim Compensation Program for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder.
Harris said: "For too many children, seeing shootings or stabbings in their neighborhoods is far too common. Before this law, there was no help."
Leno's bill was signed into law by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Harris created a unit within her office to tackle environmental crimes.
Harris filed charges against the Alameda Publishing Corporation for dumping hazardous printing ink in San Francisco's Bayview neighborhood.
50 gallon buckets of hazardous ink were left overturned and leaking: the corporation and its publishers were charged with unlawful disposal and transportation of hazardous waste and with depositing of hazardous substances on a road.
Later that year, Harris brought charges against four San Francisco residents for illegally trafficking in red abalone.
Decades of poaching abalone, a seafood delicacy, had decimated local populations before local legislators cracked down on the trade.
Harris also created a special Hate Crimes Unit, focusing on hate crimes against LGBT children and teens in schools.
In early 2006, Gwen Araujo, a 17-year old American Latina transgender teenager was murdered by two men who later used the "gay panic defense" before being convicted of second-degree murder.
Harris, alongside Araujo's mother Sylvia Guerrero, convened a two-day conference of at least 200 prosecutors and law enforcement officials nationwide to discuss strategies to counter such legal defenses saying, "the suggestion that criminal conduct is mitigated by bias or prejudice is inappropriate. We can't outlaw it, but we can combat it."
Harris subsequently supported A.B. 1160, the Gwen Araujo Justice for Victims Act, advocating that California's penal code include jury instructions to ignore bias, sympathy, prejudice or public opinion in making their decision, also making mandatory for district attorney's offices in California to educate prosecutors about panic strategies and how to prevent bias from affecting trial outcomes.
In September 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed A.B. 1160 into law; the law put California on record as declaring it contrary to public policy for defendants to be acquitted or convicted of a lesser included offense on the basis of appeals to "societal bias".
In 2005, Harris obtained a guilty plea from former San Francisco school official Tim Tronson for fraud and tax evasion.
Tronson was originally charged with 22 felony counts in connection with the alleged scheme to divert $500,000 out of a construction escrow account to be paid to an outfit under the control of another consultant, Alpha Omega Bibbs III.
Bibbs then allegedly gave the money back to Tronson in the form of checks, who went to a Santa Cruz check cashing facility to convert at least $350,000 from the checks into money orders.
Tronson served four years in state prison and was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and $500,000 in restitution.
In 2006, Republican Ed Jew won a highly competitive election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.
Harris began investigating Jew for violating residency requirements necessary to hold his supervisor position.
Harris alleged that Jew lied under oath and falsified documents regarding his residency in the Sunset District so he could run for the District 4 seat for supervisor, adding that Jew has never resided at the 28th Avenue home or any other home in District 4 during his run for office.
Jew maintained that he did reside at the Sunset home, but records associated with the 28th Avenue house that Jew claimed as his primary residence showed that water to the home had been shut off since March 2006 and the service wasn't started in Jew's name until Sept. 2006, more than 60 days after he would have been required to live there.
Facing an arrest warrant and nine felony charges, Jew turned himself in.
Thereafter, Mayor Gavin Newsom suspended Jew and began the process of removing him from office.
On January 10, 2008, Jew resigned, swearing never to seek public office again.
On October 10, 2008, Jew pleaded guilty to federal mail fraud and extortion charges and state perjury charges and was sentenced to 64 months in state prison, fined $10,000 for the federal extortion charge, and another $2000 on the perjury charge.
In the early 2000s, the City and County of San Francisco murder rate per capita drastically outpaced the national average.
When Harris took office, she cleared part of the murder caseload from the previous administration.
She stated that the records from that administration were less than ideal, and worked to get convictions on what she could.
Out of the 73 homicide cases backlogged, over 40% of them took deals for lesser charges, such as manslaughter, pleaded to other crimes, such as assault or burglary while the murder charges were dismissed.
Nevertheless, Harris achieved a 90% conviction rate in her homicide cases.
Harris also pushed for higher bail for criminal defendants involved in gun-related crimes, arguing that historically low bail encouraged outsiders to commit crimes in San Francisco.
Officers within the San Francisco Police Department credited Harris with tightening loopholes in bail and drug programs that defendants had used in the past.
In addition to creating a gun crime unit, Harris opposed releasing defendants on their own recognizance if they were arrested on gun crimes, sought minimum 90-day sentences for possession of concealed or loaded weapons, and charged all assault weapons possession cases as felonies, adding that she would seek prison terms for criminals who possess or use assault weapons and maximum penalties on gun-related crimes:
""If you carry an illegal gun in the city of San Francisco and your case is brought to my office, you are going to spend time in jail.
Period.""
In April 2005, Harris pursued the prosecution of Charles Rothenberg a.k.a. Charley Charles, under California's three strikes law for illegal possession of a firearm.
Rothenberg became infamous in the 1980s when he set his 6-year-old son on fire amidst a custody dispute with his ex-wife.
Rothenberg previously served 6 1/2 years in prison for dousing the hotel room in kerosene and setting it ablaze with his son was asleep.
Having been convicted of attempted murder and arson, and now illegal firearm possession, Rothernberg's act constituted a third "strike" under state law and triggering a sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
In August 2007, State Assemblyman Mark Leno introduced legislation to ban gun shows at the Cow Palace in Daly City, CA, joined by Harris, Police Chief Heather Fong and Mayor Gavin Newsom.
City leaders contended the shows were directly contributing to the proliferation of illegal guns and spiking homicide rates in San Francisco: Mayor Newsom earlier that month signed into law local legislation banning gun shows on city and county property.
Leno alleged that gun show merchants drove through the public housing developments near the arena, including Sunnydale, and illegally sold weapons to residents.
While the bill would stall for years, local opposition to the gun shows would continue, until the Cow Palace Board of Directors in 2019 voted to approve a statement banning all future gun shows in the space.
On November 12, 2008, Harris announced her candidacy for California Attorney General.
Both of California's United States Senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, endorsed her during the Democratic Party primary.
She also received the endorsement of United Farm Workers cofounder Dolores Huerta and Mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa.
In the June 8, 2010, primary, she was nominated with 33.6% of the vote, defeating Alberto Torrico and Chris Kelly.
In the general election, she faced Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley, who led the race in polling until the final moments.
Cooley ran as a nonpartisan prosecutor, distancing himself from the Meg Whitman campaign.
However, during a debate on October 5, Cooley complained about the low salary of the attorney general, stating his intention to accept a pension and the salary in a practice known as "double-dipping."
Harris' turned his remarks into a cutting political ad that portrayed Cooley as out-of-touch.
Cooley did not respond with a negative ad of his own until the last two weeks of the campaign, attacking Harris on her refusal to seek the death penalty in the Espinoza case.
Harris campaigned aggressively in Los Angeles, including attending seven Sunday services in black churches in one day.
On October 22, 2010, President Barack Obama spoke to a crowd of nearly 38,000 people at a political rally in support of candidates for statewide office in California at USC, including U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer, Attorney General Jerry Brown, who was running for Governor, and Harris.
Cooley outspent Harris, $7 million to $4.5 million.
On election night, November 2, 2010, Cooley prematurely declared victory, but many mail-in and provisional ballots remained uncounted, with the lead changing four times.
On November 24, as the count advanced, Harris led by more than 55,000 votes.
Cooley conceded the next day
On January 3, 2011, Harris made history as the first female, Jamaican-American and Indian-American attorney general in California.
Harris announced her intention to run for re-election in February 2014 and filed paperwork to run on February 12.
According to the office of California Secretary of State Debra Bowen, Harris had raised the money for her campaign during the previous year in 2013.
The Sacramento Bee, Los Angeles Daily News, and Los Angeles Times endorsed her for reelection.
On November 4, 2014, Harris was re-elected against Republican Ronald Gold in a landslide victory, winning 57.5% of the vote to Gold's 42.5%.
In 2008, California voters passed Prop 8, a California ballot proposition and a state constitutional amendment defining marriage between a man and a woman.
Legal challenges to Prop 8 were presented by opponents quickly after its approval, and a pair of same-sex couples filed a lawsuit against the initiative in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in the case Perry v. Schwarzenegger (later Hollingsworth v. Perry).
In August 2010, Chief Judge Vaughn Walker ruled that the amendment was unconstitutional under both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, since it purported to re-remove rights from a disfavored class only, with no rational basis.
The official proponents' justifications for the measure were analyzed in over fifty pages covering eighty findings of fact.
The state government supported the ruling and refused to defend the law.
In their 2010 campaigns, both California Attorney General Jerry Brown and Harris both ran on platforms promising not to defend the proposition.
After being elected, Harris declared her office would not defend the marriage ban, leaving the task to Prop 8's proponents.
On February 7, 2012, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2–1 decision, reached the same conclusion as the district court, but on narrower grounds.
The court ruled that it was unconstitutional for California to grant marriage rights to same-sex couples, only to take them away shortly after.
The ruling was stayed pending appeal to the United States Supreme Court.
On December 7, 2012, the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari, ordering the parties to brief and argue the additional question of whether supporters of Prop.
8 have standing, i.e., a legal right to be involved in the case, under Article III, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution.
On February 27, 2013, Harris filed an amicus curiae brief with the Court, arguing that Prop 8 was unconstitutional and that initiative's sponsors did not have standing to represent California's interests by defending the law in federal court.
On June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court issued its decision on the appeal, ruling that proponents of initiatives such as Proposition 8 did not possess legal standing in their own right to defend the resulting law in federal court, either to the Supreme Court or (previously) to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Therefore, the Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Ninth Circuit, and remanded the case for further proceedings.
The decision left the district court's 2010 ruling intact.
On June 27, 2013, Harris, in a speech delivered in downtown Los Angeles, declared that all 58 counties in California must abide by Judge Walker's 2010 ruling that declared Prop 8 unconstitutional and urging the Ninth Circuit to lift the stay on same-sex marriages as soon as possible — even before the usual 25-day waiting period until the Supreme Court clerk notified the lower court of its judgement.
The next day, the Ninth Circuit, on remand, dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and dissolved their previous stay of the district court's ruling, enabling Governor Jerry Brown to order same-sex marriages to resume.
The same day, Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier, plaintiffs in the case, married with Harris officiating the ceremony.
In 2012, conversion therapists filed two lawsuits, Pickup v. Brown (12-17681) and Welch v. Brown (13-15023), challenging the constitutionality of S.B. 1172, which banned the practice of therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation on children under the age of 18, effective January 2013.
There is no reliable evidence that sexual orientation can be changed and medical institutions warn that conversion therapy practices are ineffective and potentially harmful.
In December 2012, the district court judge hearing Pickup declined to issue an injunction blocking SB 1172, but the judge hearing Welch did issue an injunction.
Both cases were appealed to and consolidated in the Ninth Circuit.
The circuit court heard oral arguments in the cases on April 17, 2013, and on August 29, upheld SB 1172 and reversed the lower court order granting a preliminary injunction.
"The plaintiffs in the case asked the Supreme Court of the United States to review the Ninth Circuit's decision. However, on June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court declined to grant review, sending the law into effect."
The Supreme Court later explicitly referenced a specific line of argument in this case relating to the standard of scrutiny that should be afforded to regulations of professional speech.
In 2012, Harris sent a letter to 100 mobile-app developers, asking them to comply with California law with respect to privacy issues.
If any developer of an application that could be used by a Californian does not display a privacy policy statement when the application is installed, California law is broken, with a possible fine of $2500 for every download.
The law affects any developer anywhere in the world if the app is used by a Californian.
On February 2015, Harris announced that she would start a new agency called the Bureau of Children's Justice.
The bureau would work on issues such as foster care, the juvenile justice system, school truancy, and childhood trauma.
She appointed special assistant attorney general Jill Habig to head the agency.
In 2016, Harris announced a $168.5 million settlement with K-12, Inc., an online charter school, over claims it engaged in false advertising and inflated the academic progress of its students.
The corporation received more than $310 million in funding for its highly profitable but poorly performing online charter schools, which served about 15,000 students.
Later that year, working with Assemblyman Mark Leno, Harris supported legislation that significantly limited the punitive use of isolating juveniles in solitary confinement; Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill into law in September 2016.
In 2011, Harris announced the creation of the Mortgage Fraud Strike Force, consisting of a consumer enforcement team, a criminal enforcement team, and a corporate fraud team.
Shortly thereafter, Harris announced a joint investigatory alliance with Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto to combine investigative resources and strategy, as California and Nevada were the two states hit hardest in the foreclosure crisis; California led the nation in total 546,669 foreclosure filings while Nevada led the nation in percentage of foreclosures at 9.4%, or 106,160 housing units.
That same year, Harris obtained the largest recovery in the history of California's False Claims Act - $241 million - with Quest Diagnostics, the state's biggest provider of medical laboratory testing, of a lawsuit alleging illegal overcharges to the state's medical program for the poor.
That same year, Harris obtained yet another record-breaking settlement - $323 million - with the SCAN healthcare network - over excess state Medi-Cal and federal Medicare payments.
In 2012, Harris leveraged California's outsize economic clout as the fifth largest economy in the world to obtain better terms in the National Mortgage Settlement against the nation's five largest banks - JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Ally Bank.
In her memoir, The Truths We Hold, Harris said that initial negotiations with the banks had yielded an offer that amounted to "crumbs," or $2 to $4 billion in relief for California residents.
Harris indicated she was prepared to pull out of the negotiations if the banks weren't willing to increase their offer.
In a meeting with the five chief counsel of the banks at Debevoise and Plimpton, the general counsel of JP Morgan said to Harris that his parents had voted for her and that voters back home would be happy with her if she just settled.
Harris responded:
""Do I need to remind you this is a law enforcement action?""
After the meeting, Harris decided to pull out of the negotiations.
Her allies, Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden and Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto backed her decision.
Her refusal to budge caused JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon to call her office in a rage, accusing her of stealing from his shareholders.
Harris took off her earrings and yelled back that he was ripping off her constituents before tempers cooled and negotiations resumed anew.
Dimon promised he would talk to the board to see what he would do.
Two weeks later, the offer swelled to $18 billion, and then $20 billion in debt reduction for California's homeowners.
In her memoir, The Truths We Hold, Harris recalls working with Assembly Speaker John Pérez in 2013 to introduce the Homeowner Bill of Rights.
Along with Senate President pro tem Darrell Steinberg, the trio whipped the votes in the Assembly and the Senate, and the California Homeowner's Bill of Rights, considered one of the strongest protections nationwide against aggressive foreclosure tactics, went into effect on January 1, 2013.
The Homeowner Bill of Rights banned the practices of "dual-tracking" (processing a modification and foreclosure at the same time) and robo-signing and provided homeowners with a single point of contact at their lending institution.
The bill also empowered the California Attorney General more power to investigate and prosecute financial fraud, to levy civil penalties on fraudulently signed mortgage documents, convene special grand juries and to prosecute multi-county crimes instead of prosecuting a single crime county by county.
Harris achieved multiple nine-figure settlements for California homeowners under the Homeowner Bill of Rights, namely robo-signing and dual-track abuses, as well as prosecuting instances in which loan processors failed to promptly credit mortgage payments, miscalculated interest rates, and charged borrowers improper fees.
Harris secured hundreds of millions in relief, including $268 million from Ocwen Financial Corporation, $470 million from HSBC, and $550 million from SunTrust Banks.
From late 2013 to early 2015, Harris alleged misrepresentation in residential mortgage-backed securities sold to California's public employee and teacher's pensions, CalPERS and CalSTRS against various financial giants.
Accordingly, Harris secured multiple nine-figure settlements for the state, recovering about $193 million from Citigroup, $210 million from S&P, $300 million from JP Morgan Chase, and over half a billion from Bank of America.
In 2013, Harris declined to file a civil enforcement action against future U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin (then a private citizen) and his bank OneWest despite evidence "suggestive of widespread misconduct."
While investigators in Harris' office recommended filing an action against the bank, they also noted that such an action would result in OneWest, a federally chartered bank, to assert that the state claims would be pre-empted by federal regulations imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act and trigger prolonged and costly litigation at taxpayer expense.
With the law against them and protracted litigation anticipated, Harris exercised prosecutorial discretion and declined to pursue further action.
In 2017, she said that her office's decision was based on "following the facts and the evidence...like any other case."
Harris' press secretary later noted correctly that the state attorney general's office was additionally hampered by an inability to issue subpoenas due to OneWest Bank's status as a federally chartered bank.
Binding Supreme Court precedent have consistently held that "[...] state laws that conflict with federal law are 'without effect'"
In 2013, Harris filed suit against for-profit post-secondary education company Corinthian Colleges for false advertising and deceptive marketing targeting vulnerable, low-income students and misrepresenting job placement rates to students, investors, and accreditation agencies.
In internal company documents, Corinthian described its target demographic as 'isolated,' 'impatient,' individuals with 'low self-esteem,' who have 'few people in their lives who care about them' and who are 'stuck' and 'unable to see and plan well for future." In 2015, Corinthian filed for bankruptcy protection, but Harris obtained a $1.2 billion judgment, with the court ordering Corinthian to pay $820 million in restitution and another $350 million in civil penalties. Evidence obtained by Harris’ office was later used by the U.S. Department of Education as part of a joint investigation which concluded the programs misrepresented their placement rates to enrolled and prospective students. The investigations formed the basis for Education Secretary Arne Duncan to announce expanded debt relief options for defrauded Corinthian students.
In 2014, Harris forced rent-to-own retailer Aaron's, Inc. to refund $28.4 million to California customers and pay $3.4 million in civil penalties to settle allegations that it violated California's Karnette Rental-Purchase Act by charging improper late fees, overcharging customers who paid off contracts early, and omitting important contract disclosures.
Aaron's also violated California state privacy laws by permitting its franchised stores to install spyware on rented computers, allowing franchisees to remotely monitor keystrokes, capture screenshots, and even activate the webcam.
According to a report on the rent-to-own industry by the National Consumer Law Center, nearly all rent-to-own customers have a household income of below $50,000 and the vast majority are people of color and have attained a high school education or less.
In 2016, Harris secured a $15 million settlement for Californians who had invested with Stanley Chais, the West Coast operator of the so-called "feeder funds" which collected money for funds related to the Bernie Madoff trading scandal and Ponzi scheme.
California's Proposition 69 mandated law enforcement to collect DNA samples from any adult arrested for a felony and from individuals arrested for certain crimes.
In 2012, Harris announced that the California Department of Justice had improved its DNA testing capabilities such that samples stored at the state's seven crime labs could now be analyzed four times faster, within 30 days.
Accordingly, Harris reported that her officials cleared California's entire DNA backlog for the first time ever.
Harris' Rapid DNA Service Team within the Bureau of Forensic Services, developed a process that allowed higher volume analysis of 5,400 evidence samples – an increase of 11% from 2010 (4,800) and 24% from 2009 (4,100).
In April 2014, Harris' team was honored with the U.S. Department of Justice's Award for Professional Innovation in Victim Services.
Harris' office would later be awarded a $1.6 million grant from the Manhattan District Attorney's initiative to eliminate the backlogs of untested rape kits.
In November 2013, Harris launched the California Department of Justice's Division of Recidivism Reduction and Re-Entry in partnership with district attorney offices in San Diego, Los Angeles, and Alameda County.
Building off Back on Track, the division was formed to develop a consistent definition of recidivism, allocate grants for anti-recidivism programs, and creating recidivism metrics through the use of data.
In March 2015, Harris announced the creation of a recidivism reduction pilot program in coordination with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department called "Back on Track LA."
Like Back on Track, individuals participating in the pilot program for 24-30 months, and included non-serious, non-violent and non-sexual criminal offenders between 18 and 30.
Assigned a case manager or coach, participants received education through a partnership with the Los Angeles Community College District and job training services.
An assessment of the Back on Track LA pilot program by the American Society of Criminology found that graduates showed significantly higher self-esteem and decision-making ability, significantly lower levels of depression, entitlement, criminal rationalization, justification of antisocial behavior, and personal irresponsibility compared to the control group.
On balance, the results showed that Back on Track LA was effective in showing significant decrease on general propensity for recidivism.
In 2014, after a rash of racially motivated police killings nationwide, Harris conducted an extensive 90-day review of implicit bias and use of force.
In April 2015, Harris introduced the first of its kind "Principled Policing: Procedural Justice and Implicit Bias" training course, designed in conjunction with Stanford University psychologist and professor Jennifer Eberhardt, to help law enforcement officers overcome barriers to neutral policing and rebuild the relationship of trust between law enforcement and the community.
All Command-level staff within the California Department of Justice received the training, while additional resources were deployed to increase the recruitment and hiring of diverse special agents and trainees.
In 2015, a California superior courts judge issued an order to eject all 250 prosecutors from the Orange County District Attorney's office from a high-profile mass murder case over allegations of misconduct by Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, who was alleged to have illegally employed jailhouse informants and concealed evidence.
The court also ordered Harris to take over the criminal case, which she appealed, noting that it seemed unnecessary to ban all 250 prosecutors in the Orange County District Attorney's Office from working on the case, as only a few had been directly involved in it.
Harris later promised a narrower criminal investigation into the case at hand.
The U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation into Rackauckas in December 2016, but he was not re-elected.
His successor Todd Spitzer later stated his office willing to undergo federal probation to end the investigation.
Later that year, Harris' California Department of Justice was the first statewide agency in the country to require all of its police officers to wear body cameras.
Harris said she believed that all officers should wear cameras, but did not believe in imposing statewide standards to regulate the use of body cameras, cautioning against a "one-size-fits-all approach."
In September 2015, Harris, alongside Congresswoman Karen Bass, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck, and UC Berkeley professor of public policy Steven Raphael announced the launch of OpenJustice, a first-in-the-nation criminal justice data initiative making available statewide data on arrest rates, deaths in law enforcement custody, arrest-related deaths, and law enforcement deaths.
The tool consisted of two components: a Dashboard that spotlights key criminal justice indicators with user-friendly visualization tools and an Open Data Portal that publishes raw data from the California Department of Justice's statewide repository of criminal justice datasets.
Subsequent improvements to the platform revealed data pertaining to clearance rates and racial disparities in the criminal justice system.
In 2011, Harris created the eCrime Unit within the California Department of Justice, a 20-attorney unit specifically targeting technology crimes.
Thereafter, several purveyors of so-called "revenge porn" sites based in California were arrested, charged with felonies, and sentenced to lengthy prison terms.
In the first prosecution of its kind in the United States, Kevin Bollaert was convicted on 21 counts of identity theft and six counts of extortion.
He was later sentenced to 18 years in prison.
Harris said, "Sitting behind a computer, committing what is essentially a cowardly and criminal act will not shield predators from the law or jail."
Harris echoed these words when California Congresswoman Katie Hill was targeted for similar cyber exploitation by her ex-husband and forced to resign in late 2019.
In 2011, Harris secured a comprehensive $44 million settlement to resolve all natural resource damages, penalties, and response costs associated with the 2007 Cosco Busan oil spill, where aforementioned container ship collided with the Delta Tower of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge and spilled more than 50,000 gallons of bunker fuel into the San Francisco Bay.
In the aftermath of the 2015 Refugio oil spill, which deposited over 3000 barrels or about 140,000 gallons of crude oil off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, Harris toured the coastline and directed her office's resources and attorneys to investigate possible criminal violations.
Thereafter, operator Plains All American Pipeline was indicted on 46 criminal charges related to the spill, with one employee indicted on 3 criminal charges.
In 2019, a Santa Barbara jury returned a verdict finding Plains guilty of failing to properly maintain its pipeline and another eight misdemeanor charges including one count of failing to follow its own spill plan and notify emergency response agencies, six counts of killing marine mammals, protected sea birds, and other marine life, and one count of violating a county ordinance prohibiting oil spills; they were sentenced to pay over $3 million in fines and assessments.
In summer 2016, automaker Volkswagen AG agreed to pay up to $14.7 billion to settle a raft of government and consumer claims related to so-called "defeat devices" used to cheat emissions standards on its diesel cars while actually emitting up to 40 times the levels of harmful nitrogen oxides allowed under state and federal law.
Harris and the chair of the California Air Resources Board, Mary D. Nichols, announced that California would receive $1.18 billion in the settlement, as well as another $86 million paid to the state of California in civil penalties.
Harris secured multiple multimillion dollar settlements with fuel service companies BP, ARCO, Phillips 66, and ConocoPhillips to resolve allegations they failed to properly monitor the hazardous materials in its underground storage tanks used to store gasoline for retail sale at hundreds of California gas stations.
In summer 2012, Harris signed an accord with her counterpart, the Attorney General of Mexico, Marisela Morales to improve coordination of law enforcement resources targeting transnational gangs that engage in the sale and trafficking of human beings across the California-Mexico border.
The accord called for closer integration on human trafficking investigations between the two offices and the sharing of best practices for law enforcement to recognize instances of human trafficking and provide support and services to victims.
In September 2012, Harris announced that Governor Jerry Brown had signed into law two bills she sponsored to combat human trafficking.
A.B. 2466 ensured that criminal defendants involved in human trafficking will not dispose of assets that would otherwise be provided as restitution to victims, while S.B. 1133 expanded the list of assets that a human trafficker must forfeit and provides a formula for using those resources to help victims of human trafficking.
In November 2012, at an all-day symposium attended by U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis and Attorney General Morales, Harris presented a report titled "The State of Human Trafficking in California 2012," outlining the growing prevalence of human trafficking in the state, and highlighting the increasing involvement of transnational gangs perpetrating the crime through sophisticated use of technology.
In 2014, Harris announced the arrest of four suspects operating a sex trafficking ring out of a massage parlor in Emeryville, CA, recovering over $69,000 in cash.
One defendant was later sentenced to 10 years after pleading guilty.
In 2016, Harris charged Andrew Jordan, 36, with six felony counts of human trafficking in Long Beach, CA.
Jordan was later found guilty and sentenced to 21 years in prison Later that year, Harris announced the arrest of Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer on felony charges of pimping a minor, pimping, and conspiracy to commit pimping.
The arrest warrant alleged that 99% of Backpage's revenue was directly attributable to prostitution-related ads, many of which involved victims of sex trafficking, including children under the age of 18.
The pimping charge against Ferrer was dismissed by the California courts in 2016 on the grounds of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, but in 2018 Ferrer ultimately pleaded guilty in California to money laundering and agreed to give evidence against the former co-owners of Backpage, Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin.
Ferrer simultaneously pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering and conspiracy to facilitate prostitution in Texas state court and Arizona federal court.
Under government pressure, Backpage announced that it was removing its adult section from all of its sites in the United States.
Harris welcomed the move, saying "I look forward to them shutting down completely."
The investigations continued after she became a senator and in April 2018, Backpage and affiliated sites were seized by federal law enforcement around the same time as Ferrer's guilty plea.
In 2011, Harris won a court order reviving a fraud lawsuit against CalPERS board member Alfred J.R. Villalobos and former CalPERS chief executive Federico Buenrosto, Jr. after they declared bankruptcy to avoid state charges.
Villalobos was paid more than $47 million in commissions to help private equity firms steer contracts to manage $4.8 billion worth of assets from 2005 to 2009.
In 2012, Harris secured a $2.8 million settlement from Medco Health Solutions, who had paid Villalobos $4 million to help the company land a pharmacy benefits contract.
In 2014, Villalobos and Buenrosto were later indicted in federal court on bribery and corruption charges in connection with an influence operation regarding the retirement fund's investment decisions.
Buenrosto testified that Villalobos bribed executives, creating false documents, and steering investment deals to private equity firms.
Facing up to 30 years in prison for the scandal, Villalobos committed suicide just a week before he was scheduled to go on trial.
Harris later secured a $20 million settlement from Villalobos' bankruptcy estate to settle the bribery allegations.
In early 2011, Harris ordered the arrest of three men with ties to the Tijuana Cartel suspected of plotting to murder a family in San Diego, seizing two assault weapons, more than 1000 rounds of ammunition, and an estimated $20,000 in cash.
Later that year, Harris ordered three coordinated law enforcement sweeps in Contra Costa County, the Central Valley, and San Bernardino County, resulting in hundreds of arrests of multiple gang leaders of Nuestra Familia Norteños, Nuestra Familia, and the Vagos Motorcycle Club, respectively.
Law enforcement officers also disrupted gang operations by seizing vast quantities of methamphetamine, cash, and illegal firearms, including an anti-tank gun and a rocket launcher.
In early 2014, Harris issued a report titled, "Gangs Beyond Borders: California and the Fight Against Transnational Crime."
Harris' report shed light on three "pillars," addressing the prominent role of drug, weapons, and human trafficking, money laundering, and technology crimes and offering recommendations for state and local law enforcement to combat the criminal activity.
The report also called for increased international partnerships to leverage technology against high-profile organizations, including various drug cartels from Mexico, Armenian Power, 18th Street Gang, and MS-13.
Later that year, Harris led a bipartisan delegation of state attorneys general to Mexico City to meet with their Mexican counterparts to discuss joint efforts to address transnational crime, culminating in the signing of a letter of intent with the Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores and establishing a bi-national working group on enforcement of money laundering.
Following the visit to Mexico City, Harris convened a summit focused on the use of technology to fight transnational organized crime with state and federal officials from the U.S., Mexico, and El Salvador, held in association with the annual meeting of the U.S. Conference of Western Attorneys General.
Attendees included Attorney General of Mexico Jesus Murillo Karam and Attorney General of El Salvador Luis Martinez.
That October, Harris announced the creation of a new anti-methamphetamine task force based in Los Angeles within the California Department of Justice.
Later that month, Harris announced the takedown of another gang in Contra Costa County, yielding the arrest of over 22 individuals, and the seizure of 500 pounds of methamphetamine, valued at $18 million, and over $700,000 in U.S. currency.
In 2015, Harris ordered the arrest of 75 individuals in Merced County and 52 individuals in Tulare County affiliated with the Norteños, as part as "Operation Red Sol" and "Operation Red Right Hand," respectively.
Harris' office also broke up a massive identity theft and tax fraud scam perpetrated by an offshoot of the Crips in Long Beach, CA.
22 members of the gang were arrested on charges that included 283 counts of criminal conspiracy, 299 counts of identity theft, and 226 counts of grand theft, amount to over $3.3 million stolen by an identity theft scheme and $11 million stolen by a tax fraud scheme.
In 2016, Harris announced wide-sweeping arrests of over 50 members of the Mexican Mafia a.k.a. La Eme, seizing more than 60 firearms, more than $95,000 in cash, and $1.6 million worth of methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana in Riverside County.
Later that year, Harris' office coordinated with federal agents in a raid on dozens of businesses in the Los Angeles Fashion District suspected to be operating as part of a major money-laundering hub for narcotics traffickers in Mexico, arresting nine people on charges of money laundering through a black market peso exchange scheme and seizing nearly $65 million in illegal proceeds.
During Obama's presidency, Harris was mentioned as a possible nominee for U.S. Attorney General.
In her memoir, The Truths We Hold, Harris recounts a moment in 2014 when she answered a call from Eric Holder, informing her he was stepping down and asking if she was interested.
Harris informed Holder if there was a budget at the Department of Justice to fund and create incentives for local re-entry initiatives, she would be interested.
Holder explained no budget existed and any new spending would have to be approved by a Republican controlled Congress.
Thereafter, Harris publicly stated she was not interested in succeeding him as U.S. Attorney General.
After the sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016, Harris was speculated to be a possible replacement as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
However, as her campaign had already begun, Harris publicly stated she did not wish to be considered for the vacancy, adding she was only interested in running for the U.S. Senate.
Accordingly, she was not nominated to either office.
After 24 years as California's junior senator, Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) announced her intention to retire from the United States Senate at the end of her term in 2016.
Harris was the first candidate to declare her intention to run for Boxer's senate seat.
Media outlets reported that she would run for senate on the same day that Gavin Newsom, California's Lieutenant Governor and a close political ally of Harris, announced he would not seek to succeed Boxer.
In December 2015, the National Journal reported that Harris' campaign spending rate contributed to her cash on hand being closer to that of another candidate, Loretta Sanchez, who had just $1.6 million.
Harris officially announced the launch of her campaign on January 13, 2015.
Harris was a frontrunner from the beginning of her campaign.
In January 2015, weeks after she announced her campaign, a survey by Public Policy Polling showed her leading in a hypothetical match-up against Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, 41% to 16%, respectively.
California politician statewide declined to run against her including statewide officials John Chiang, John Garamendi, Bill Lockyer, Gavin Newsom, and Alex Padilla who decided to run for re-election or another office.
Four months later, a Field Poll showed that though nearly 60% of likely voters did not have a favored candidate, at nearly 20%, she was most preferred candidate of the field.
Five months later, she led another Field Poll, at 30%, besting fellow Democratic candidate, Loretta Sanchez, by nearly 15 percentage points.
Harris increased her support despite The Sacramento Bee noting she had not been active in campaigning since appearing at the California Democratic Party's convention.
In February 2016, the California Democratic Party voted at its convention to endorse Harris, who received nearly 80% of the vote, with only 60% needed to secure the endorsement.
Three months later, Governor Jerry Brown endorsed her.
Harris hosted fundraisers in California and Washington, D.C., raising $2.5 million for her campaign.
Harris was the only Democratic candidate for the Senate to receive a campaign contribution from financier and Hollywood producer Steven Mnuchin.
Mnuchin donated $2,000 to Harris' campaign.
Harris was criticized for accepting the donation because Mnuchin purportedly profited from the subprime mortgage crisis through OneWest Bank; Harris later voted against Mnuchin's confirmation as U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.
All candidates participated in a primary election in June 2016, after which the top two candidates from any party would advance to the general election.
Harris entered the debates against the other major candidates as the front-runner.
On the June 7 primary, she came in first place with 40% of the votes, winning in over 80% of California's 58 counties –– including seven counties where she won more than 50% of the vote.
On July 19, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden endorsed Harris.
Following the primary, Harris faced Congresswoman, and fellow Democrat, Loretta Sanchez, in the general election.
It was the first time a Republican did not appear in a general election for the Senate since California began directly electing senators in 1914.
In the November 2016 election, Harris defeated Sanchez, capturing over 60% of the vote, carrying all but four counties.
Following her victory, she promised to protect immigrants from the policies of President-elect Donald Trump.
Following her election to the United States Senate, Harris announced her intention to remain California's Attorney General through the end of 2016 and resign shortly before being sworn in as Senator on January 3, 2017.
Governor Jerry Brown announced his intention to nominate Congressman Xavier Becerra as her successor.
On January 28, after Trump signed Executive Order 13769, barring citizens from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days, she condemned the order and was one of many to describe it as a "Muslim ban".
When John F. Kelly was White House Chief of Staff, she called him at home to gather information and push back against the contentious executive order.
In February 2017, Harris spoke in opposition to Trump's cabinet picks Betsy DeVos, for Secretary of Education, and Jeff Sessions, for United States Attorney General.
Later that month, in her first speech on the Senate floor, she spent 12 minutes critiquing Trump's immigration policies.
In early March, she called on Attorney General Sessions to resign, after it was reported that Sessions spoke twice with Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak.
On March 14, she argued that repealing the Affordable Care Act would send the message of health care's being a "privilege" rather than a "civil right."
She later voted against the so-called "Repeal and Replace" Republican healthcare plan.
On June 7, 2017, Harris garnered media attention for her questioning of Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, over the role he played in the May 2017 firing of James Comey, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The prosecutorial nature of her questioning caused Senator John McCain, an ex officio member of the Intelligence Committee, and Senator Richard Burr, the committee chairman, to interrupt her and request that she be more respectful of the witness; other Democrats on the committee pointed out that they had asked similarly tough questions, but had not been interrupted.
On June 13, 2017, she questioned Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, on the same topic; She was again interrupted by McCain and Burr.
Sessions stated that her mode of questioning "makes me nervous"; other Democratic members of the committee again pointed out that she was the only senator whose questioning was interrupted with an admonishment from the chairman.
Burr's singling out of Harris sparked suggestion in the news media that his behavior was sexist, with commentators arguing that Burr would not treat a male Senate colleague in a similar manner.
In addition, when CNN pundit Jason Miller described her as "hysterical", Kirsten Powers, who was taking part in the same on-air segment, told Miller that his use of the term to describe Harris was sexist, and that he would not describe male senators in the same manner.
In November 2017, Harris traveled to Israel and the West Bank, where she met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and spoke with Palestinian students at Al-Quds University in Abu Dis.
In January 2018, Harris was appointed to the Senate Judiciary Committee after former Senator Al Franken resigned in disgrace over multiple allegations of sexual harassment.
Later that month, Harris questioned Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen for favoring Norwegian immigrants over others and claiming to be unaware that Norway is a predominantly white country.
In an April 2018 hearing, Harris questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for Facebook's misuse of users' data.
In May 2018, Harris questioned Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie on reports that Cambridge Analytica misappropriated the data from 87 million Facebook users to suppress the votes of African Americans, also asking him the extent of the privacy violations that Facebook reportedly abetted.
In June 2018, in response to the administration's family separation policy, Harris visited one of the detention facilities near the border in San Diego.
Later that month, Harris again questioned DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, this time on reports concerning federal agents forcibly removing children from their parents under the family separation policy.
Thereafter, Harris was the first Senator to demand Nielsen's resignation.
In the September and October 2018 Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Harris questioned Brett Kavanaugh about a meeting he may have had regarding the Mueller Investigation with a member of Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by the President's personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz.
Kavanaugh was unable to answer and repeatedly deflected.
Harris also participated in questioning the FBI Director's limited scope of the investigation on Kavanaugh regarding allegations of sexual assault.
She joined her colleagues in voting against his confirmation.
Harris, along with Senate colleague Cory Booker, was one of the targets of the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts.
In November 2018, Harris toured the areas ravaged by the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history.
In December 2018, Harris traveled to Kabul, Mazar-e Sharif, and Kandahar in Afghanistan with two of her Republican colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senators Burr and Lankford.
Later that month, Harris, along with Republican Senator Tim Scott and Democratic Senator Cory Booker, led the passage by unanimous consent of the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act, legislation that criminalized lynching for the first time in American history.
From 1882 to 1986, Congress failed to pass anti-lynching legislation 200 times.
In May 2019, Barr testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee one day after it was reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller told Barr his 4-page summary of the Mueller Report failed to "fully capture the findings."
During the hearing, Barr remained defiant about the misrepresentations in the four-page summary he released ahead of the full report.
First, Harris asked whether Barr had reviewed the underlying evidence before deciding not to charge the President with obstruction of justice, to which Barr admitted that neither he, Rod Rosenstein, nor anyone in his office reviewed the evidence supporting the report before making the charging decision.
Harris then asked:
""Has the President or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone?
Yes or no, please, sir.""
Barr stuttered, unable to answer her question.
Thereafter, Harris called for Barr to resign, adding that he refused to answer her questions because he would open himself up to perjury.
Harris' questioning of Barr later went viral.
Two days later, Harris demanded again that the Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz investigate whether Attorney General Barr acceded to pressure from the White House to investigate his political enemies.
In the aftermath of her questioning of Attorney General Barr, President Trump reportedly called Harris "nasty."
In December 2019, Harris led a group of Democratic Senators in demanding the immediate removal of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller after emails published by the Southern Poverty Law Center revealed extensive coordination with far-right website Breitbart to shape stories related to race and immigration and encouraging writers to draw on material from white supremacy sources, such as the racist 1973 French novel The Camp of the Saints.
Prominent civil rights organizations, including the NAACP echoed Harris' demand for Miller's resignation.
Ahead of the Impeachment trial of Donald Trump on January 16, 2020, Harris delivered remarks on the floor of the Senate, stating her views on the integrity of the American justice system and the principle that nobody is above the law:
""We now face a choice: will we insist that we have one system of justice that applies equally to all?
Or will we continue to have two systems of justice, in which some are above the law?
[…] This moment in our history will have consequences.
The Senate is charged with deciding whether the President of the United States, with all of his power and supposed wealth, will be held accountable for his actions – or whether we will finally live up to the principle: ‘Equal Justice Under Law.’""
Harris later asked Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham to halt all judicial nominations during the impeachment trial.
Hours later, Senator Graham acquiesced.
Along with her Democratic colleagues, Harris voted to convict the President on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
On February 12, 2020 Harris pressed Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, Senator Ron Johnson for a public hearing about the coronavirus with public health officials, pointing out that administration officials were unwilling to attend the hearing about protecting the country from the possibility of a pandemic.
In March 2020, Harris questioned DHS official Ken Cuccinelli about preparations taken to safeguard vulnerable populations against the coronavirus, sending a letter to the Federal Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal about their preparations for coronavirus among federal prison population.
Despite historic levels of political polarization in the U.S. Senate, Harris has a strong record of bipartisan cooperation with her Republican colleagues.
Harris has also introduced a multitude of bills with Republican co-sponsors, including a bail reform bill with Senator Rand Paul, an election security bill with Senator James Lankford, and a workplace harassment bill with Senator Lisa Murkowski.
Other Republican Senators working with Harris on the Senate Intelligence Committee, including Marco Rubio, Richard Burr, and Roy Blunt have also praised her as "well-prepared," "effective," and "a quick study."
Harris is a member of the following committees:
Harris had been considered a top contender and potential frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination for President.
In June 2018, she was quoted as "not ruling it out."
In July 2018, it was announced that she would publish a memoir, a sign of a possible run.
As of that month, she was spending more on Facebook advertising than any other senator.
She also stumped for candidates in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina.
On January 21, 2019, Harris officially announced her candidacy for President of the United States in the 2020 United States presidential election.
In the first 24 hours after her candidacy announcement, she tied a record set by Bernie Sanders in 2016 for the most donations raised in the day following an announcement.
However, Sanders later broke this record after announcing his own 2020 presidential campaign.
Over 20,000 people attended her formal campaign launch event in her hometown of Oakland, California on January 27, according to a police estimate.
During the first Democratic presidential debate in June 2019, Harris scolded former vice president Joe Biden for "hurtful" remarks he made, speaking fondly of Senators who opposed integration efforts in the 1970s and working with them to oppose mandatory school bussing.
Her widely quoted comment was, "There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day. That little girl was me."
Harris's support rose by between 6 and 9 points in polls following that debate.
In the second debate in August, Harris was confronted by Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard over her record as Attorney General, notably her past positions on marijuana, cash bail, and parole reform.
Though Gabbard's accusations were widely discredited by fact-checkers in the immediate aftermath, Harris fell in the polls following that debate.
Over the next few months her poll numbers fell to the low single digits.
On December 3, 2019, Harris withdrew from seeking the 2020 Democratic nomination,  citing a shortage of funds to continue her campaign.
In March 2020, Harris endorsed Joe Biden for president.
In December 2018, former Vice President Joe Biden posed for a photo together with Harris in Washington, D.C., sparking speculation about their presidential bids and the possibility of a Biden-Harris ticket.
After they launched their campaigns, in May 2019, senior members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Representatives Lacy Clay, Anthony G. Brown, Emanuel Cleaver, and Marcia Fudge said that a Biden-Harris ticket would be an ideal combination to defeat Donald Trump.
After their dispute in the first presidential debate in June 2019, Biden supporters claimed that the "dream ticket" would never happen.
Biden expressed surprise when Harris dropped out of the race on December 3, 2019.
The next day he said he would consider Harris as a potential running mate for his presidential campaign, adding that she "has the capacity to be anything she wants to be. She is solid. She can be president someday herself. She can be the vice president. She can go on to be a Supreme Court justice. She can be an attorney general."
In January 2020, Biden reiterated that Harris was "qualified to be president" and that he would consider her "for anything she wants, including VP."
In late February, Biden won a landslide victory in the 2020 South Carolina Democratic primary with the endorsement of House Whip Jim Clyburn.
More victories in the Super Tuesday states soon followed.
In early March, Clyburn suggested Biden choose a black woman as a running mate, noting that "African American women needed to be rewarded for their loyalty," naming Harris, Marcia Fudge, Val Demings, and Keisha Lance Bottoms as possible choices.
During a debate, Biden committed to choosing a woman for his running mate.
As he continued to win more primaries, on March 22, Biden set forth the criteria for his running mate - noting that his vice president must have sufficient experience to be ready on "Day One" to be president should he be unable to serve.
Biden also noted that he would value a similar respectful and trust-based relationship that he enjoyed with President Barack Obama, describing it as "simpatico."
On April 7, civil rights icon and Congressman John Lewis endorsed Joe Biden, urging him to pick a woman of color to be his running mate.
On April 17, Harris responded to media speculation and said that while she "would be honored" to be Biden's running mate, her current focus was on resolving issues affecting minority communities as relates to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and preparing to negotiate the details of the next relief bill in the Senate.
Political commentators have observed that Harris would be Biden's "best choice" and the "Do No Harm" running mate, meeting the Vice President's criteria and shoring up his perceived weaknesses.
Harris is married to California attorney Douglas Emhoff, who was at one time partner-in-charge at Venable LLP's Los Angeles office.
